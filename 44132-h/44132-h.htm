<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>


<p class="pmb2">Many of the persons and personages who appear
upon the pages of this book have already
lived, some in history and some in the pages of
"Tom Strong, Washington's Scout," "Tom
Strong, Boy-Captain," "Tom Strong, Junior,"
or "Tom Strong, Third." Those who wish to
know the full story of the four Tom Strongs,
great-grandfather, grandfather, father and son,
should read those books, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom Rides in Western Maryland&mdash;Halted by
Armed Men&mdash;John Brown&mdash;The Attack
upon Harper's Ferry&mdash;The Fight&mdash;John
Brown's Soul Goes Marching On.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>On a beautiful October afternoon, a man and
a boy were riding along a country road
in Western Maryland. To their left lay the
Potomac, its waters gleaming and sparkling
beneath the rays of the setting sun. To their
right, low hills, wooded to the top, bounded the
view. They had left the little town of Harper's
Ferry, Virginia, an hour before; had crossed to
the Maryland shore of the Potomac; and now
were looking for some country inn or friendly
farmhouse where they and their horses could be
cared for overnight.</p>

<p>The man was Mr. Thomas Strong, once Tom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Strong, third, and the boy was his son, another
Tom Strong, the fourth to bear that name. Like
the three before him he was brown and strong,
resolute and eager, with a smile that told of a
nature of sunshine and cheer. They were looking
for land. Mr. Strong had inherited much
land in New York City. The growth of that
great town had given him a comfortable fortune.
He had decided to buy a farm somewhere
and a friend had told him that Western Maryland
was almost a paradise. So it was, but this
Eden had its serpent. Slavery was there. It
was a mild and patriarchal kind of slavery, but
it had left its black mark upon the countryside.
Across the nearby Mason and Dixon's line,
Pennsylvania was full of little farms, tilled by
their owners, and of little towns, which reflected
the wealth of the neighboring farmers. Western
Maryland was largely owned by absentee
landlords. Its towns were tiny villages. Its
farms were few and far between. The free State
was briskly alive; the slave State was sleepily
dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The two riders were splendidly mounted, the
father on a big bay stallion, Billy-boy, and the
son on a black Morgan mare, Jennie. Billy-boy
was a descendant of the Billy-boy General
Washington had given to the first Tom Strong,
many years before. Jennie was a descendant
of the Jennie Tom Strong, third, had ridden
across the plains of the great West with John
C. Fremont, "the Pathfinder," first Republican
candidate for President of the United States.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen a house for miles, Father,"
said the boy.</p>

<p>"And we were never out of sight of a house
when we were riding through Pennsylvania.
There's always a reason for such things. Do
you know the reason?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. What is it?"</p>

<p>"The sin of slavery. I don't believe I shall
buy land in Maryland. I thought I might plant
a colony of happy people here and help to make
Maryland free, in the course of years, but I'm
beginning to think the right kind of white people
won't come where the only work is done by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
slaves. We must find soon a place to sleep.
Perhaps there'll be a house around that next
turn in the road. Billy-boy whinnies as though
there were other horses near."</p>

<p>Billy-boy's sharp nose had not deceived him.
There were other horses near. Just around the
turn of the road there were three horses. Three
armed men were upon them. Father and son
at the same moment saw and heard them.</p>

<p>"You stop! Who be you?"</p>

<p>The sharp command was backed by uplifted
pistols. The Strongs reined in their horses,
with indignant surprise. Who were these three
farmers who seemed to be playing bandits upon
the peaceful highroad? The boy glanced at his
father and tried to imitate his father's cool demeanor.
He felt the shock of surprise, but his
heart beat joyously with the thought: "This is
an adventure!" All his young life he had
longed for adventures. He had deeply enjoyed
the novel experience of the week's ride with the
father he loved, but he had not hoped for a
thrill like this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Strong eyed the three horsemen, who
seemed both awkward and uneasy. "What
does this mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Now, thar ain't goin' to be no harm done
you nor done bub, thar, neither," the leader of
the highwaymen answered, with a note almost
of pleading in his voice. "Don't you be oneasy.
But you'll have to come with us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And spend Sunday with us&mdash;&mdash;" broke in
another man.</p>

<p>"Shet up, Bill. I'll do all the talkin' that's
needed."</p>

<p>"That's what you do best," the other man
grumbled.</p>

<p>"Well, Tom," said Mr. Strong, turning with
a smile to his son, "we seem to have found that
place to spend the night." He faced his captors.
"This is a queer performance of yours. You
don't look like highwaymen, though you act like
them. Do you mean to steal our horses?" he
added, sharply.</p>

<p>"We ain't no hoss thieves," replied the
leader. "You've got to come with us, but you
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
needn't be no way oneasy. You, Bill, ride
ahead!"</p>

<p>Bill turned his horse and rode ahead, Mr.
Strong and Tom riding behind him, the other
two men behind them. It was a silent ride, but
not a long one. Within a mile, they reached a
rude clearing that held a couple of log huts.
The sun had set; the short twilight was over.
Firelight gleamed in the larger of the huts. The
prisoners were taken to it. A man who was
lounging outside the door had a whispered talk
with the three horsemen. Then he turned
rather sheepishly; said: "Come in, mister;
come in, bub;" opened the door, called within:
"Prisoners, Captin' Smith," and stepped aside
as father and son entered.</p>

<p>There were a dozen men in the big room,
farmers all, apparently. They were all on their
feet, eyeing keenly the unexpected prisoners.
Their eyes turned to a tall man, who stepped
forward and held out his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Sorry the boys had to take you in, but
you and your hosses are safe and we won't
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
keep you long. The day of the Lord is at
hand."</p>

<p>There was a grim murmur of approval from
the other men. The Lord's day, as Sunday is
sometimes called, was at hand, for it was then
the evening of Saturday, October 15, 1859. But
that was not what the speaker meant. He was
not what his followers called him, Captain
Smith. He was John Brown, of North Elba,
New York, of Kansas ("bleeding Kansas" it
was called then, when slaveholders from Missouri
and freedom-lovers under John Brown had
turned it into a battlefield), and he was soon to
be John Brown of Harper's Ferry, Virginia,
first martyr in the cause of Freedom on Virginian
soil. To him "the day of the Lord" was
the day when he was to attack slavery in its
birthplace, the Old Dominion, and that attack
had been set by him for Sunday, October 16.
His plan was to seize Harper's Ferry, where
there was a United States arsenal, arm the
slaves he thought would come to his standard
from all Virginia, and so compass the fall of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Slave Power. A wild plan, an impossible
plan, the plan of an almost crazy fanatic, and a
splendid dream, a dream for the sake of which
he was glad to give his heroic life.</p>

<p class="pmb2">He had rented this Maryland farm in July,
giving his name as Smith and saying he expected
to breed horses. By twos and threes his followers
had joined him in this solitary spot, until
now there were twenty-one of them. The few
folk scattered through the countryside had begun
to be suspicious of this strange gathering of
men. All sorts of wild stories circulated, though
none was as wild as the truth. The men themselves
were tense under the strain of the long
wait. They feared discovery and attack. For
the three days before "the day of the Lord"
they had patrolled the one road, looking out
for soldiers or for spies. Tom and his father had
been their sole captives.</p>

  <span class="caption font08 smcap">John Brown</span>
</div>


<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>John Brown was one of Nature's noblemen
and among his friends in Massachusetts and
New York were some of the foremost men of
their time, so he had learned to know a real man
when he met one. He soon found out that Mr.
Strong was a real man. He told him of his
plans, and urged him to join in the projected
foray on Harper's Ferry. But when Mr. Strong
refused and tried to show him how mad his
project was, the fires of the fanatic blazed within
him.</p>

<p>"Did not Joshua bring down the walls of
Jericho with a ram's horn?" he shouted. "And
with twenty armed men cannot I pull down the
walls of the citadel of Slavery? Are you a true
man or not? Will you join me or not? Answer
me yes or no."</p>

<p>"No," was the response, quiet but firm.</p>

<p>"You shall join me; you and your boy,"
thundered the crusader, hammering the table
with his mighty fist. "Here, Jim, put these
people under guard and keep them until we
start."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom and his father were well-treated, but they
were kept under guard until the next night
and were then taken along by John Brown's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"army," which trudged off into the darkness
afoot, while Billy-boy and Jennie and the other
horses in the corral whinnied uneasily, sensing,
as animals do, the stir of a departure which is to
leave them behind. In the center of the little
column the two captives marched the five miles
to Harper's Ferry and started across the bridge
that led to that tiny town.</p>

<p>A brave man, one Patrick Hoggins, was night-watchman
of the bridge. He heard the trampling
of many feet upon the plank-flooring. He
hurried towards the strange sound.</p>

<p>"Halt!" shouted somebody in the column.</p>

<p>"Now I didn't know what 'halt' mint then,"
Patrick testified afterwards, "anny more than a
hog knows about a holiday."</p>

<p>But he had seen armed men and he turned
to run and give an alarm. A bullet was swifter
than he, but not swifter than his voice. He
fell, but his shouts had alarmed the town.
There were two or three watchmen at the
arsenal. They came forward, only to be made
prisoners. The few citizens who had been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
aroused could do nothing. The "army" seized
the arsenal without difficulty.</p>

<p>Five miles from Harper's Ferry lived Col.
Lewis W. Washington, gentleman-farmer and
slave-owner, great-grand-nephew of another
gentleman-farmer and slave-owner, George
Washington. At midnight, Colonel Washington
was awakened by a blow upon his bedroom
door. It swung open and the light of a burning
torch showed the astonished Southerner four
armed men, one of them a negro, who bade him
rise and dress. They were a patrol sent out by
Brown. Their leader, Stevens, asked:</p>

<p>"Haven't you a pistol Lafayette gave George
Washington and a sword Frederick the Great
sent him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"Downstairs."</p>

<p>His four captors tramped downstairs with
him. Pistol and sword were found.</p>

<p>"I'll take the pistol," said Stevens. "You
hand the sword to this negro."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>John Brown wore this sword during the fighting
that followed. It is now in the possession
of the State of New York. While its being sent
George Washington by Frederick the Great is
doubtful&mdash;the story runs that the Prussian king
sent with it a message "From the oldest general
to the best general"&mdash;its being surrendered
by Lewis Washington to the negro is true.</p>

<p>Lewis was then on the staff of the Governor
of Virginia, and had acquired in this way his
title of Colonel. He was put into his own carriage.
His slaves, few in number, were bundled
into a four-horse farm-wagon. They were told
to come and fight for their freedom. Too scared
to resist, they came as they were bidden to do,
but they did no fighting. At Harper's Ferry
they and their fellow-slaves, seized at a neighboring
plantation, escaped back to slavery at the
first possible moment. Not a single negro voluntarily
joined John Brown. He had expected
a widespread slave insurrection. There was
nothing of the sort. By Monday morning he
knew he had failed, failed utterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Monday's sun set, Harper's Ferry was
full of soldiers, United States regulars and State
militia. Brown, his men and his white captives,
eleven of the latter, were shut up in the fire-engine
house of the armory. The militia refused
to charge the engine-house, saying that this
might cost the captives their lives. Many of
them were drunk; all of them were undisciplined;
their commander did not know how to
command. The situation changed with the arrival
of the United States Marines led by
Lieut.-Col. Robert E. Lee, afterwards the famous
chief of the army of the Confederate
States.</p>

<p>By this time Tom was beginning to think he
had had enough adventure. He had enjoyed
that silent tramp through the darkness beside
his father. He had enjoyed it the more because
they were both prisoners-of-war. Being a prisoner
was an amazingly thrilling thing. He was
sorry when brave Patrick Hoggins was shot and
glad to know the wound was slight, but sharing
in the skirmish, even in the humble capacity of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a captive, had excited the boy immensely. Now
that there was almost constant firing back and
forth, when two or three wounded men were
lying on the floor, and when his father and he
and Colonel Washington were perforce risking
their lives in the engine-house, with nothing to
gain and everything to lose, and when scanty
sleep and little food had tired out even his stout
little body, Tom felt quite ready to go home and
have his adored mother "mother" him. His
father saw the homesickness in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Steady, my son," said Mr. Strong. "This
won't last long. No stray bullet is apt to reach
this corner, where Captain Brown has put us.
The only other danger is when the regulars rush
in here, but unless they mistake us for the
raiders, there'll be no harm done then. Steady."
He looked through a bullet-hole in the boarded-up
window and added: "Here comes a flag of
truce. Listen."</p>

<p>The scattering fire died away. The hush was
broken by a commanding voice, demanding surrender.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"There will be no surrender," quoth grim
John Brown.</p>

<p class="pmb2">At dawn of Tuesday, two files of United
States Marines, using a long ladder as a battering
ram, attacked the door. It broke at the
second blow. The marines poured in, shooting
and striking. The battle was over. John Brown,
wounded and beaten to the floor, lay there
among his men. The captives were free. Their
captors had changed places with them.</p>

  <span class="caption font08">THE ATTACK ON THE ENGINE-HOUSE</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">Colonel Washington took Mr. Strong and
Tom home with him, for a rest after the strain
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the captivity. He was much interested when
he found out that Tom's great-grandfather had
visited General Washington at Mount Vernon
and Tom was intensely interested in seeing the
home and home life of a rich Southern planter.
The Colonel asked his guests to stay until after
the trial of their recent jailer. They did so and
Mr. Strong, after some hesitation, decided to
take Tom to the trial and afterwards to the final
scene of all. He wrote to his wife: "Life is
rich, my dear, in proportion to the number of
our experiences and their depth. Ordinarily, I
would not dream of taking Tom to see a criminal
hung. But John Brown is no ordinary criminal.
He is wrong, but he is heroic. He faces his fate&mdash;for
of course they will hang him&mdash;like a
Roman. I think it will do Tom good to see a
hero die."</p>

<p>Whether or no his father was right, Tom was
given these experiences. He sat beside his
father and Colonel Washington at the trial. He
heard them testify. He noted the angry stir of
the mob in the court-room when Mr. Strong
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
made no secret of his admiration for the great
criminal.</p>

<p>Robert E. Lee, who captured Brown, said:
"I am glad we did not have to kill him, for I
believe he is an honest, conscientious old man."
Virginia, Lee's State, thought she did have to
kill this invader of her soil and disturber of her
slaves.</p>

<p>November 2, John Brown was sentenced to be
hung December 2. The next day he added this
postscript to a letter he had already written to
his wife and children:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"P.S. Yesterday Nov. 2d I was sentenced to
be hanged on Decem 2d next. Do not grieve on
my account. I am still quite cheerful. God
bless you all."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Northern friends offered to try to help him to
break jail. He put aside the offer with the calm
statement: "I am fully persuaded that I am
worth inconceivably more to hang than for any
other purpose."</p>

<p>December 2, John Brown started on his last
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
journey. He sat upon his coffin in a wagon and
as the two horses paced slowly from jail to gallows,
he looked far afield, over river and valley
and hill, and said: "This <i>is</i> a beautiful country."
He was sure he was upon the threshold of a far
more beautiful country. The gallows were
guarded by a militia company from Richmond,
Virginia. In its ranks, rifle on shoulder, stood
Wilkes Booth, a dark and sinister figure, who
was to win eternal infamy by assassinating
Abraham Lincoln. Beside the militia was a trim
lot of cadets, the fine boys of the Virginia Military
Institute. With them was their professor,
Thomas J. Jackson, "Stonewall" Jackson, one
of the heroic figures upon the Southern side of
our Civil War.</p>

<p>When the end came, Stonewall Jackson's lips
moved with a prayer for John Brown's soul;
Colonel Washington's and Mr. Strong's eyes
were wet; and Tom Strong sobbed aloud.
Albany fired a hundred guns in John Brown's
honor as he hung from the gallows. In 1859
United States troops captured him that he
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
might die. In 1899 United States troops fired
a volley of honor over his grave in North Elba
that the memory of him might live. Victor
Hugo called him "an apostle and a hero."
Emerson dubbed him "saint." Oswald Garrison
Villard closes his fine biography of John
Brown with these words: "Wherever there is
battling against injustice and oppression, the
Charlestown gallows that became a cross will
help men to live and die."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our War with Mexico&mdash;Kit Carson and His
Lawyer, Abe Lincoln&mdash;Tom Goes to Lincoln's
Inauguration&mdash;S. F. B. Morse, Inventor
of the Telegraph&mdash;Tom Back in
Washington.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>In 1846, Mr. Strong, long enough out of Yale
to have begun business and to have married,
had heard his country's call and had helped her
fight her unjust war with Mexico. General
Grant, who saw his first fighting in this war and
who fought well, says of it in his Memoirs that
it was "one of the most unjust ever waged by
a stronger against a weaker nation."</p>

<p>Much more important things were happening
here then than the Mexican War. In 1846
Elias Howe invented the sewing-machine. In
1847 Robert Hoe invented the rotary printing
press. Great inventions like these are the real
milestones of the path of progress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Strong served as a private in the ranks
throughout the war. He refused a commission
offered him for gallantry in action because he
knew he did not know enough then to command
men. It is a rare man who knows that he does
not know. His regiment was mustered out of
service at the end of the war in New Orleans.
The young soldier decided to go home by way
of St. Louis because of his memories of that old
town in the days when he had followed Fremont.
He went again to the Planters' Hotel and there
by lucky accident he met again the famous
frontiersman Kit Carson. Carson was away
from the plains he loved because of a lawsuit.
A sharp speculator was trying to take away
from him some land he had bought years ago
near the town, which the growth of the town
had now made quite valuable. Carson was
heartily glad to see his "Tom-boy" once more.
He insisted upon his staying several days, took
him to court to hear the trial, and introduced
him to his lawyer, a tall, gaunt, slab-sided,
slouching, plain person from the neighboring
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
State of Illinois. Everybody who knew him
called him "Abe." His last name was
Lincoln.</p>

<p>"I'd heard so much of Abe Lincoln," said
Carson, "that when this speculator who's trying
to do me hired all the big lawyers in St. Louis,
I just went over to Springfield, Illinois, to get
Abe. When I saw him I rather hesitated about
hiring such a looking skeesicks, but when I
came to talk with him, he did the hesitating. I
asked him what he'd charge for defending a
land-suit in St. Louis. He told me. I sez: 'All
right. You're hired. You're my lawyer.'</p>

<p>"'Wait a bit,' sez he.</p>

<p>"'What for?' sez I. 'I'll pay what you said.'</p>

<p>"'That ain't all,' sez he. 'Before I take your
money, Kit, I've got to know your side of the
case is the right side.'</p>

<p>"'What difference does that make to a
lawyer?' sez I.</p>

<p>"'It makes a heap o' difference to this
lawyer,' sez he. 'You've got to prove your case
to me before I'll try to prove it to the court. If
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
you ain't in the right, Abe Lincoln won't be your
lawyer.'</p>

<p>"Darned if he didn't make me prove I was in
the right, too, before he'd touch my money. No
wonder they call him 'Honest Abe.'"</p>

<p>It took Lincoln a couple of days to win Kit
Carson's suit. During those two days young
Strong saw much of him and came to admire
the sterling qualities of the man. Lincoln, too,
liked this young college-bred fellow from the
East, unaffected, well-mannered, friendly, and
gay. There was the beginning of a friendship
between the Westerner and the Easterner.
Thereafter they wrote each other occasionally.
When Lincoln served his one brief term in
Congress, Mr. Strong spent a week with him in
Washington and asked him (but in vain) to visit
him in New York.</p>

<p>So, when this new giant came out of the
West and Illinois gave her greatest son to the
country, as its President, Mr. Strong went to
Washington to see him inaugurated and took
with him his boy Tom, as his father had taken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
him in 1829 to Andrew Jackson's inauguration.</p>

<p>Washington was still a great shabby village,
not much more attractive March 4, 1861, than
it was March 4, 1829. The crowds at the two
inaugurations were much alike. In both cases
the favorite son of the West had won at the
polls. In both cases the West swamped Washington.
But in 1829 there was jubilant victory
in the air. In 1861 there was somber anxiety.
Seven Southern States had "seceded" and had
formed another government. Other States
were upon the brink of secession. Was the
great democratic experiment of the world about
to end in failure? Would there be civil war?
What was this unknown man out of the West
going to do? Could he do anything?</p>

<p>Mr. Strong and Tom, with a few thousand
other people, went to the reception at the White
House on the afternoon of March fourth.
President Lincoln was laboriously shaking
hands with everybody in the long line. Almost
every one of them seemed to be asking him for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
something. He was weary long before Tom
and his father reached him, but his face brightened
as he saw them. A boy always meant a
great deal to Abraham Lincoln. "There <i>may</i>
be so much in a boy," he used to say. He
greeted the two warmly.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Strong? Glad to see you. This
your boy? Howdy, sonny?"</p>

<p>Tom did not enjoy being called "sonny"
much more than he had enjoyed being called
"bub," but he was glad to have this big man
with a woman's smile call him anything. He
wrung the President's offered hand, stammered
something shyly, and was passing on with his
father, when Lincoln said:</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute, Strong. You haven't
asked me for anything."</p>

<p>"I've nothing to ask for, Mr. President. I'm
not here to beg for an office."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! You're the only man in
Washington of that kind, I believe. Come to
see me tomorrow morning, will you?"</p>

<p>"Most gladly, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The impatient man behind them pushed them
on. They heard him begin to plead: "Say, Abe,
you know I carried Mattoon for you; I'd like to
be Minister to England."</p>

<p>Boys and girls always appealed to the President's
heart. When there were talks of vital
import in his office, little Tad Lincoln often sat
upon his father's knee. At a White House reception,
Charles A. Dana once put his little girl
in a corner, whence she saw the show. The
father tells the story. When the reception was
over, he said to Lincoln: "'I have a little girl
here who wants to shake hands with you.' He
went over to her and took her up and kissed
her and talked to her. She will never forget
it if she lives to be a thousand years
old."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning Tom followed his father
into a room on the second floor of the White
House. Lincoln sat at a flat-topped desk, piled
high with papers. He was in his shirt-sleeves,
with shabby black trousers, coarse stockings,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and worn slippers. He stretched out his long
legs, swung his long arms behind his head, and
came straight to the point.</p>

<p>"Strong, I'm going to need you. Your country
is going to need you. I want you to go
straight home and fix up your business affairs
so you can come whenever I call you. Will you
do it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>President and citizen rose and shook hands
upon it. The citizen was about to go when
Tom, with his heart in his mouth, but with a
fine resolve in his heart, suddenly said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Father! Oh, Mr. President&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped short, too shy to speak, but
Lincoln stooped down to him, patted his young
head and said with infinite kindness in his
tone:</p>

<p>"What is it, Tom? Tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. President, I'm only a boy, but can't
I do something for my country, right now?
Can't I stay here? Father will let me, won't
you, Father?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Strong shook his head. The boy's face
fell. It brightened again when Lincoln told
him:</p>

<p>"When I send for your father, I'll send for
you, Tom."</p>

<p>With that promise ringing in his ears, Tom
went home to New York City. Home was a
fine brick house at the northeast corner of
Washington Place and Greene Street. The
house was a twin brother of those that still
stand on the north side of Washington Square.
Tom had been born in it. Not long after his
birth, his parents had given a notable dinner in
it to a notable man. Tom had been present at
the dinner, and he remembered nothing about
it. As he was at the table but a few minutes,
in the arms of his nurse, and less than a year
old, it is not surprising that he did not remember
it. His proud young mother had exhibited him
to a group of money magnates, gathered at Mr.
Strong's shining mahogany table for dinner, at
the fashionable hour of three <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, to see
another young thing, almost as young as Tom.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
This other young thing was the telegraph, just
invented by Samuel F. B. Morse, at the University
of the City of New York, which then
filled half of the eastern boundary of Washington
Square.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Tom waited in the old brick house and
played in Washington Square, history was making
itself. Pope Walker, first Secretary of War
of the Confederate States, sitting in his office at
the Alabama Statehouse at Montgomery, the
first Confederate capital, said: "It is time to
sprinkle some blood in the face of the people."
So he telegraphed the fateful order to fire on
Fort Sumter, held by United States troops in
Charleston harbor. Sumter fell. Lincoln called
for 75,000 volunteers. Virginia, the famous Old
Dominion, "the Mother of Presidents"&mdash;Washington,
Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were
Virginians&mdash;seceded. The war between the
States began.</p>

<p>Mr. Strong found in his mail one day this
letter:</p>

<p class="pmb2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<div class="block2">

<p class="right">"The Executive Mansion,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Washington, April 17, 1861.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sir:</p>

<p>The President bids me say that he would like
to have you come to Washington at once and
bring your son Tom with you.</p>

<p class="center">
Respectfully,</p>

<p class="right pmb2"><span class="smcap">John Hay</span>,<br />
Assistant Private Secretary."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Tom and his father started at once, as the
President bade them. At Jersey City, they
found the train they had expected to take had
been pre-empted by the Sixth Massachusetts, a
crack militia regiment of the Old Bay State,
which was hurrying to Washington in the hope
of getting there before the rebels did. The
cars were crammed with soldiers. A sentry
stood at every door. No civilian need apply for
passage. However, a civilian with a letter
from Lincoln's secretary bidding him also hurry
to Washington was in a class by himself. With
the help of an officer, the father and son ran the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
blockade of bayonets and started southward, the
only civilians upon the train. It was packed to
suffocation with soldiers. Mr. Strong sat with
the regimental officers, but he let Tom roam at
will from car to car. How the boy enjoyed it.
The shining gun-barrels fascinated him. He
joined a group of merry men, who hailed him
with a shout:</p>

<p>"Here's the youngest recruit of all."</p>

<p>"Are you really going to shoot rebels?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"If we must," said Jack Saltonstall, breaking
the silence the question brought, "but I hope it
won't come to that."</p>

<p>"The war will be over in three months,"
Gordon Abbott prophesied.</p>

<p>"Pooh, it will never begin,&mdash;and I'm sorry for
that," said Jim Casey, "I'd like to have some
real fighting."</p>

<p>Within about three hours, Jim Casey was to
see fighting and was to die for his country. The
beginning of bloodshed in our Civil War was in
the streets of Baltimore on April 19, 1861, just
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
eighty-six years to a day from the beginning of
bloodshed in our Revolution on Lexington Common.
Massachusetts and British blood in 1775;
Massachusetts and Maryland blood in 1861.</p>

<p>When the long train stopped at the wooden
car-shed which was then the Baltimore station,
the regiment left the cars, fell into line and
started to march the mile or so of cobblestone
streets to the other station where the train for
Washington awaited it. The line of march was
through as bad a slum as an American city
could then show. Grog-shops swarmed in it and
about every grog-shop swarmed the toughs of
Baltimore. They were known locally as "plug-uglies."
Like the New York "Bowery boys"
of that time, they affected a sort of uniform,
black dress trousers thrust into boot-tops and
red flannel shirts. Far too poor to own slaves
themselves, they had gathered here to fight the
slave-owners' battles, to keep the Massachusetts
troops from "polluting the soil of Maryland," as
their leaders put it, really to keep them from
saving Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>A roar of jeers and taunts and insults hailed
the head of the marching column. Tom was
startled by it. He turned to his father. The
two were walking side by side, in the center of
the column, between two companies of the
militia. He found his father had already turned
to him.</p>

<p>"Keep close to me, Tom," said Mr. Strong.</p>

<p>The storm of words that beat upon them increased.
At the next corner, stones took the
place of words. The mob surged alongside the
soldiers, swearing, stoning, striking, finally stabbing
and shooting. The Sixth Massachusetts
showed admirable self-restraint, which the
"plug-uglies" thought was cowardice. They
pressed closer. With a mighty rush, five thousand
rioters broke the line of the thousand
troops. The latter were forced into small
groups, many of them without an officer. Each
group had to act for itself. Tom and his father
found themselves part of a tiny force of about
twenty men, beset upon every side by desperadoes
now mad with liquor and with the lust
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of killing. Jack Saltonstall took command by
common consent. Calmly he faced hundreds of
rioters.</p>

<p>"Forward, march!"</p>

<p>As he uttered the words, he pitched forward,
shot through the chest. A giant "plug-ugly"
bellowed with triumph over his successful shot,
yelled "kill 'em all!" and led the mob upon
them. But Mr. Strong had snatched Saltonstall's
gun as it fell from his nerveless hands,
had leveled and aimed it, and had shouted
"fire!" to willing ears. A score of guns rang
out. The mob-leader whirled about and
dropped. Half-a-dozen other "plug-uglies" lay
about him. This section of the mob broke and
ran. Some of them fired as they ran, and Jim
Casey's life went out of him.</p>

<p>"Take this gun, Tom," said Mr. Strong.</p>

<p>The boy took it, reloading it as he marched,
while his sturdy father lifted the wounded
Saltonstall from the stony street and staggered
forward with the body in his arms. Casey and
two other men were dead. Their bodies had to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
be left to the fury of the mob. Saltonstall lived
to fight to the end. As the survivors of the
twenty pressed forward, the mob behind followed
them up. Bullets whizzed unpleasantly
near. Twice, at Mr. Strong's command, the
men faced about and fired a volley. In both
these volleys, Tom's gun played its part. He
had hunted before, but never such big game as
men. The joy of battle possessed him. Since
it was apparently a case of "kill or be killed,"
he shot to kill. Whether he did kill, he never
knew. The two volleys checked two threatening
rushes of the rioters and enabled Mr. Strong
to bring what was left of the gallant little band
safely to the railroad station. An hour later the
Sixth Massachusetts was in Washington. During
that hour Tom had been violently sick upon
the train. He was new to this trade of man-killing.</p>

<p>At Washington, once vacant spaces were soon
filled with camps. Soldiers poured in on every
train. Orderlies were galloping about. Artillery
surrounded the Capitol. And from its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
dome Tom saw a Confederate flag, the Stars-and-Bars,
flying defiantly in nearby Alexandria.</p>

<p>Those were dark days. There were Confederate
forces within a few miles of the White
House. Sumter surrendered April 15th. Virginia
seceded on the 17th. Harper's Ferry fell
into Southern hands on the 18th. The Sixth
Massachusetts had fought its way through Baltimore
on the 19th. Robert E. Lee resigned his
commission in our army on the 20th and left
Arlington for Richmond, taking with him a long
train of army and navy officers whose loyal support,
now lost forever, had seemed a national
necessity. Lincoln spent many an hour in his
private office, searching with a telescope the
reaches of the Potomac, over which the troop-laden
transports were expected. Once, when he
thought he was alone, John Hay heard him call
out "with irrepressible anguish": "Why don't
they come? Why don't they come?" In public
he gave no sign of the anxiety that was eating
up his heart. He had the nerve to jest
about it. The Sixth Massachusetts, the Seventh
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
New York, and a Rhode Island detachment had
all hurried to save Washington from the capture
that threatened. When the Massachusetts men
won the race and marched proudly by the White
House, Lincoln said to some of their officers:
"I begin to believe there is no North. The Seventh
Regiment is a myth. Rhode Island is
another. You are the only real thing." They
were very real, those men of Massachusetts, and
they were the vanguard of the real army that
was to be.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Charles Francis Adams&mdash;Mr. Strong Goes to

House&mdash;Bull Run&mdash;"Stonewall" Jackson&mdash;Geo.
B. McClellan&mdash;Tom Strong, Second
Lieutenant, U. S. A.&mdash;The Battle of the
"Merrimac" and the "Monitor."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few days passed before the President had
time to see Mr. Strong and Tom. When
they were finally ushered into his working-room,
they found there, already interviewing Lincoln,
the hawk-nosed and hawk-eyed Secretary of
State, William H. Seward of New York, scholar,
statesman, and gentleman, and a short, grizzled
man, the worthy inheritor of a great tradition.
He was Charles Francis Adams of Boston, son
and grandson of two Presidents of the United
States. He had been appointed Minister to
England, just then the most important foreign
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
appointment in the world. What England was
to do or not do might spell victory or defeat for
the Union. Mr. Adams had come to receive his
final instructions for his all-important work.
And this is what happened.</p>

<p>Shabby and uncouth, Lincoln faced his two
well-dressed visitors, nodding casually to the
two New Yorkers as they entered at what
should have been a great moment.</p>

<p>"I came to thank you for my appointment,"
said Adams, "and to ask you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," replied Lincoln, "thank
Seward. He's the man that put you in." He
stretched out his legs and arms, and sighed a
deep sigh of relief. "By the way, Governor,"
he added, turning to Seward, "I've this morning
decided that Chicago post-office appointment.
Well, good-by."</p>

<p>And that was all the instruction the Minister
to Great Britain had from the President of the
United States. Even in those supreme days, the
rush of office-seekers, the struggle for the spoils,
the mad looting of the public offices for partisan
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
purposes, was monopolizing the time and absorbing
the mind of our greatest President.
There is a story that one man who asked him
to appoint him Minister to England, after taking
an hour of his time, ended the interview by asking
him for a pair of old boots. Civil Service
Reform has since gone far to stop this scandal
and sin, but much of it still remains. Today you
can fight for the best interests of our beloved
country by fighting the spoils system in city,
state, and nation.</p>

<p>Adams, amazed, followed Secretary Seward
out of the little room. Then Lincoln turned to
the father and son.</p>

<p>Tom had more time to look at him now. He
saw a tall man with a thin, muscular, big nose,
with heavy eyebrows above deep-set eyes and
below a square, bulging forehead, and with a
mass of black hair. The face was dark and sallow.
The firm lips relaxed as he looked down
upon the boy. A beautiful smile overflowed
them. A beautiful friendliness shone from the
deep-set eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"So this is another Tom Strong," he said.
"Howdy, Tommy?"</p>

<p>The boy smiled back, for the welcoming smile
was irresistible. He put his little hand into
Lincoln's great paw, hardened and roughened
by a youth of strenuous toil. The President
squeezed his hand. Tom was happy.</p>

<p>"You're to go to Russia, Strong," Mr.
Lincoln said to the father. "England and
France threaten to combine against us. You
must get Russia to hold them back. We'll have
a regular Minister there, but I'm going to depend
upon you. See Governor Seward. He'll
tell you all about it. Will you take Mrs. Strong
with you?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'posed you would. And how about
Tom here?"</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat quick. What was coming
now?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Strong must decide that. I suppose
he had better keep on with his school in New
York."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not let him come to school in Washington?"
asked Lincoln. "In the school of the
world? You see," he added, while that irresistible
smile again softened the firm outlines of his
big man's mouth, "you see I've taken a sort
of fancy to your boy Tom. S'pose you give him
to me while you're away. There are things he
can do for his country."</p>

<p>It was perhaps only a whim, but the whims
of a President count. A month later, Mr. and
Mrs. Strong started for St. Petersburg and Tom
reported at the White House. He was welcomed
by John Hay, a delightful young man of
twenty-three, one of the President's two private
secretaries. The welcome lacked warmth.</p>

<p>"You're to sleep in a room in the attic," said
Hay, "and I believe you're to eat with Mr.
Nicolay and me. I haven't an idea what you're
to do and between you and me and the bedpost
I don't believe the Ancient has an idea either.
Perhaps there won't be anything. Wait a while
and see."</p>

<p>The Ancient&mdash;this was a nickname his secretaries
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
had given him&mdash;had a very distinct idea,
which he had not seen fit to tell his zealous
young secretary. Tom found the waiting not
unpleasant. He had a good many unimportant
things to do. "Tad" Lincoln, though younger,
was a good playmate. The White House staff
was kind to him. Even Hay found it difficult
not to like him. Then there was the sensation
of being at the center of things, big things. He
saw men whose names were household words.
Half a dozen times he lunched with the President's
family, a plain meal with plain folks.
Even the dinners at the White House, except
the state dinners, were frugal and plain. Lincoln
drank little or no wine. He never used
tobacco. This was something of a miracle in
the case of a man from the West, for in those
days, particularly in the unconventional West,
practically every man both smoked and chewed
tobacco. The filthy spittoon was everywhere
conspicuous. We fiercely resented the tales told
our English cousins, first by Mrs. Trollope and
then by Charles Dickens, about our tobacco-chewing,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
but the resentment was so fierce because
the tales were so true. Those were dirty
days. In 1860 there were few bathrooms except
in our largest cities. Those that existed were
mostly new. In 1789, when the present Government
of the United States came into being, in
New York City, there was not one bathroom
in the whole town.</p>

<p>At these family luncheons, Tom was apt to
become conscious that Lincoln's eyes were bent
beneath their shaggy eyebrows full upon him.
There was nothing unkind in the glance, but
the boy felt it go straight through him. He
wondered what it all meant. Why was he not
given more work to do? Had he been weighed
and found wanting? He waited in suspense a
good many months.</p>

<p>The early months of waiting were not merry
months. In July, 1861, the first battle of Bull
Run had been fought and had been lost. Our
troops ran nearly thirty miles. Telegram after
telegram brought news of disgrace and defeat
to the White House. In the afternoon Lincoln
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
went to see Gen. Winfield S. Scott, then commander-in-chief
of our armies. The fat old
general was taking his afternoon nap. Awakened
with difficulty, he gurgled that everything
would come out well. Then he fell asleep again.
Before six o'clock it was known that everything
had turned out most badly. Washington itself
was threatened by the Confederate pursuit.
Lincoln had no sleep that night. The gray dawn
found him at his desk, still receiving dispatches,
still giving orders. When he left the desk,
Washington was safe.</p>

<p>It was at the beginning of the battle of Bull
Run, when the Confederates came near running
away but did not do so because the Union troops
ran first, that "Stonewall" Jackson got his famous
nickname. The brigade of another Southern
soldier, Gen. Bernard Bee, was wavering and
falling back. Its commander, trying to hearten
his men, called out to them: "Look! there's
Jackson standing like a stone wall!" The men
looked, rallied, and went on fighting. It may
have been that one thing of Jackson's example
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
that turned the tide at Bull Run, gave the battle
to the South, and prolonged the war by at
least two years. Stonewall Jackson's soldiers
were called foot-cavalry, because under his inspiring
leadership they made marches which
would have been a credit to mounted men. It
was his specialty to be where it was impossible
for him to be, by all the ordinary rules of war.
He was a thunderbolt in attack, a stone wall in
defense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In November of that sad year of 1861, the
President made another noteworthy call upon
the then commander-in-chief, Gen. George B.
McClellan. President and Secretary of State,
escorted by young Hay and younger Tom, called
upon the General at the latter's house, in the
evening. They were told he was out, but would
return soon, so they waited. McClellan did return
and was told of his patient visitors. He
walked by the open door of the room where they
were seated and went upstairs. Half an hour
later Lincoln sent a servant to tell him again
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
that they were there. Word came back that
General McClellan had gone to bed. John
Hay's diary justly speaks of "this unparalleled
insolence of epaulettes." As the three men and
the boy walked back to the White House, Hay
said:</p>

<p>"It was an insolent rebuff. Something should
be done about it."</p>

<p>Lincoln's almost godlike patience, however,
had not been worn out.</p>

<p>"It is better," the great man answered, "at
this time not to be making a point of etiquette
and personal dignity."</p>

<p>The President, however, stopped calling upon
the pompous General. After that experience,
he always sent word to McClellan to call upon
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day, at the close of a family luncheon,
the President said to Tom: "Come upstairs
with me."</p>

<p>In the little private office, Lincoln took off
his coat and waistcoat with a sigh of relief and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
lounged into his chair. He bade Tom take a
chair nearby. Then he looked at the boy for a
moment, while his wonderful smile overflowed
his strong lips.</p>

<p>"I've been studying you a bit, Tom. I think
you'll do. Now I'll tell you what I want you to
do."</p>

<p>The smile died quite away.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can keep still when you
ought to keep still? Balaam's ass isn't the only
ass that ever talked. Most asses talk&mdash;and always
at the wrong time."</p>

<p>"The last thing Father told me," Tom
answered, "was never to say anything to
anybody 'less I was sure you'd want me to
say it."</p>

<p>"Your father is a wise man, my boy. Pray
God he does what I hope he will in
Russia."</p>

<p>The serious face grew still more serious. The
long figure slouching in the chair straightened
and stiffened. The sloping shoulders seemed to
broaden, as if to bear steadfastly a weight that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
would have crushed most men. The dark eyes
gleamed with a solemn hope. Tom longed to
ask what his father was to try to do, but he
was not silly enough to put his thought into
words. Another good-by counsel his father had
given him was never to ask the President a
question, unless he had to do so. There was
silence for a moment. Then Lincoln spoke
again:</p>

<p>"You're to carry dispatches for me, Tom.
This may take you into the enemy's country
sometimes. If you were captured and were a
civilian, it might go hard with you. So I've had
you commissioned as a second lieutenant. If
you should slip into a fight occasionally I
wouldn't blame you much. Mr. Stanton, the
Secretary of War, kicked about it. He said he
didn't believe in giving commissions to babies.
I told him you could almost speak plain and
could go 'round without a nurse. Finally he
gave in. I haven't much influence with this
Administration"&mdash;here Tom looked puzzled
until the President smiled over his own jest&mdash;"but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I did get you the commission. Here
it is."</p>

<p class="pmb2">He laid the precious parchment on the desk,
put on his spectacles, took up his quill pen, and
wrote at the foot of it</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
  <img src="images/illo_069.jpg" width="200" height="72" alt="Autograph A. Lincoln" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p2">The boy's heart thrilled and throbbed. He
had never dreamed of such an opportunity and
such an honor. He was an officer of the Union.
He was to carry dispatches for the President of
the United States. His hand shook a little as
he took the commission, reverently.</p>

<p>"You've been detailed for special service, Tom.
Stanton wanted to know whether your special
service was to be to play with my boy, Tad.
Stanton was pretty mad; that's a fact. Well,
well, you must do your work so well that he'll
get over the blow. You would have thought I
was asking him for a brigadier's commission for
a girl. Well, well. Being a war messenger is
only one of your duties, son. You're to be my
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
scout. Keep your ears and eyes both open,
Tom, and your mouth shut. Ever hear the
story of what Jonah said to the whale when he
got out of him? The whale said to Jonah:
'You've given me a terrible stomach-ache.' And
Jonah said: 'That's what you got because you
didn't have sense enough to keep your mouth
shut.' But remember, Tom, to go scouting in
the right way. What I want is the truth. It's
a hard thing for a President to get. I don't
want tittle-tattle, evil gossip, idle talk. When
I was in Congress, there was a fine old fellow
in the House from Florida. I remember he
said once that the Florida wolf was 'a mean
critter that'd go snoopin' 'round twenty miles a
night ruther than not do a mischief.' Don't be
a wolf, Tom,&mdash;but don't be a lamb either, with
the wool pulled over your eyes and ears. Here's
your first job. This envelope"&mdash;Lincoln took
from the desk a sealed envelope, not addressed,
and handed it to the boy&mdash;"this envelope is for
the commander of the 'Cumberland,' in Hampton
Roads. This War Department pass will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
carry you anywhere. When Stanton signed it,
he asked me whether he was to spend a whole
day signing things for you to play with. Mrs.
Lincoln has had a uniform made for you, on the
sly. I rather think you'll find it in your room,
Tom. You'd better start tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I start this afternoon, Mr. President?"</p>

<p>"Good for you. Of course you may. I'll say
good-by to the folks for you. God bless you,
son."</p>

<p>Lincoln waved a kindly farewell as Tom, with
drumbeats in his young heart, gave a fair imitation
of an officer's salute&mdash;and strode out of the
room with what he meant to be a manly step.
Once outside, the step changed to a run. He
flew along the halls and up the stairs to the
attic. He burst into his room. On his narrow
bed lay his new uniform. Mrs. Lincoln, kindly
housewife that she was, had done her part in
the little conspiracy for the benefit of the boy
who was Tad Lincoln's beloved playmate. She
had herself smuggled an old suit of Tom's to a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
tailor, who had made from its measure the
resplendent new blue uniform that now greeted
Tom's enraptured eyes.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Lieutenant Tom Strong left
the White House for Hampton Roads. A swift
dispatch boat carried him there. He reached
the flagship on a lovely, peaceful, spring day,
and delivered his dispatches. The boat that had
taken him there was to take him back the next
morning. He was glad to have a night on a
warship. It was a new experience. And his
father had told him that experience was the best
teacher in the world. The beautiful lines of the
frigate were a joy to see. Her spick and span
cleanliness, the trim and trig sailors and marines,
the rows of polished cannon that thrust
their grim mouths out of the portholes, these
things delighted him. He was standing on the
quarter-deck with Lieutenant Morris, almost
wishing he could exchange his brand-new lieutenancy
in the army for one in the navy, when
from the Norfolk navy yard a rocket flared up
into the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that, sir?" asked Tom. "Is it a
signal to you?"</p>

<p>"I fancy it is," Morris answered, "but it isn't
meant to be. That's a rebel rocket. You know
we lost the navy-yard early in the war and we
haven't got it back&mdash;yet. That rocket went up
from there. The Secesh are up to some deviltry.
They've been signaling a good bit of late.
I wish they'd come out and give us a chance at
them. Hampton Roads is dull as ditchwater,
with not a thing happening."</p>

<p>The gallant lieutenant yawned prodigiously.
He little knew what terrible things were to happen
on the morrow. That rocket meant that the
rebel ram, the "Merrimac," the first iron-clad
vessel that ever went into action, was to sail
down Hampton Roads, where nothing ever
happened, the next morning and was to make
many things happen. The Confederates had
converted the old Union frigate, the "Merrimac,"
into a new, strange, and monstrous
thing. They had placed a battery of cannon of
a size never before mounted on shipboard upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
her deck, close to the water-line; they had built
over the battery a framework of stout timbers,
covered with armor rolled from rails, and they
had put a cast-iron bow upon this marine
marvel. A wooden ship was a mere toy to
her.</p>

<p>The next morning came&mdash;it was March 8,
1862&mdash;and the "Merrimac" came. As she
emerged from distance and mist, our scout-boats
came racing to the "Cumberland" with
news of the danger that was fast nearing her.
The news was a tonic to officers and to men.
Here at last was something to fight. Here at
last was something to do. They were all weary
of having the flagship lie, week after week,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As idle as a painted ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a painted ocean."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The men sprang to quarters with a joyful cheer.
The officers were at their posts. The gun-crews
waited impatiently for the order to fire. And
Tom, again upon the quarter-deck, thrilled with
the thrill of all about him, was glad to know that
the dispatch boat would not sail until that afternoon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and that he could see the fight. Everyone
around him was sure of victory. The foe was
soon to be sunk. The Stars-and-Bars, now flying
so impudently at her stern, was to be hung
up as a trophy in the ward-room of the "Cumberland."
It never was.</p>

<p>The ram steered straight for the flagship.
She did not fire a shot, though the flagship's
cannon roared. A tongue of fire blazed from
every porthole of the starboard side, towards
which she came, silently and swiftly. Behind
every tongue of fire there rushed a cannon-ball.
Many a ball hit the "Merrimac." A wooden
ship would have been blown to bits by the concentrated
fury of the cannonade. Alas! the
cannon-balls glanced from her armored sides
"like peas from a pop-gun." They rattled like
hail upon her and did her no more hurt than
hail-stones would have done. She came on like
an irresistible Fate. There had been shouts of
savage joy below decks when the first order to
fire had echoed through them. A burst of wild
cheering from the gun-crews had almost
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
drowned the first thunder of the guns. There
were no shouts or cheers now. Sharp orders
pierced the clangor of artillery.</p>

<p>"Stand by to board!"</p>

<p>The marines formed quickly at the starboard
bow of the "Cumberland." Then at last the
guns of the "Merrimac" spoke. She was close
upon her prey now. The sound of her first volley
was the voice of doom. Her great cannon
sent masses of iron through and through the
pitiful wooden walls that had dared to stand up
against walls of iron. The shrieks of wounded
men, of men screaming their mangled lives
away, rolled up to the quarter-deck. A messenger
dashed up there.</p>

<p>"Half the gun-crew officers are dead. Send
us others!"</p>

<p>"Go below," said Lieutenant Morris, turning
to two young midshipmen who stood near Tom,
"keep the guns manned."</p>

<p>The two middies bounded below and Tom
bounded down with them. There was no hope
of victory now, but the fight must be fought to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a finish. If the cannon could still be served, a
lucky shot might strike the foe in a vital part,
might disable her engines, might carry away her
steering-gear, might&mdash;there was a long chapter
of possible accidents to the "Merrimac" that
might still save the "Cumberland" from what
seemed to be her sure destruction. As the
three boys raced down to the gun-deck, they
saw a fearful scene. Dead and wounded men
lay everywhere. The sawdust that in those
days used to be strewn about, before entering
action, in order to soak up the blood of the men
who fell and keep the decks from growing slippery
with it, had soaked up all it could, but there
were thin red trickles flowing along the deck.
Two or three of the cannon had been dismounted.
Crushed masses that had been human
flesh lay beneath them. A dying officer half
raised himself to give one last command and fell
back dead before he could speak. The men were
standing to their task as American sailors are
wont to do, but like all men they needed leaders.
Three leaders came. The two middies and Tom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
took command of these officerless cannon. The
other two boys knew their work and did it.
Tom knew that it was his business to keep his
cannon at work and he did it. He repeated,
mechanically:</p>

<p>"Load! Fire! Load! Fire!"</p>

<p>His men responded to the command. The
cannon roared once, twice. Then there came a
sickening shock. The rebel ram drove its iron
prow home through the side of the "Cumberland."
The good ship reeled far over under the
deadly blow, righted herself, but began to sink.
Her race was run. The black bulk of the "Merrimac"
was just opposite the porthole of the
gun Tom was handling. There was a last order.
With the lips of their muzzles wet with the engulfing
sea, the cannon of the "Cumberland"
roared their last defiance of death. Down went
the ship. The sea about her was black with
wreckage and with struggling men. Boats
from other ships and from the shore darted
among them, picking them up. The dispatch
boat that had brought Tom down was busy with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that good work. The "Merrimac" could have
sunk her without effort, but of course the Confederates
never dreamed of making the effort.
Americans do not fire at drowning men. When
Tom jumped into the water, as the ship sank
beneath him, he swam to a shattered spar and
clutched it. But other men who could not swim
clutched at it too. It threatened to sink with
their added weight and carry them down with
it. So the boy, thoroughly at home in the water,
let go, turned upon his back, floated with his
nose just above the surface, and waited for the
help that was at hand. A boat-hook caught his
trousers at the waist-band. He was pulled up
to the deck of the dispatch boat. It was not
quite the way in which he had expected to board
her. From her bridge, with the deck below him
crowded with the rescued sailors of the "Cumberland,"
he saw the second sad act of that
day's tragedy.</p>

<p>The "Merrimac" had backed away, after that
terrible thrust of her iron ram, until she was
free from the ship she had destroyed. Then she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
laid her course for the "Congress," invincible
yesterday, today helplessly weak in the face of
this new terror of the seas. The "Congress"
fought to the last gasp, but that last gasp came
all too soon. Raked fore and aft by her adversary's
guns, unable to fire a single effective shot
in reply, she ran upon a shoal while trying to
escape from being rammed and lay there, no
longer a fighting machine, but a mere target for
her foe. Her captain could not hope to save
his ship. The only thing he could do was to
save the lives of such of his crew as were still
alive. And there was but one way to do that.
The "Congress" surrendered. The Stars-and-Stripes
fluttered down from her masthead. In
place of the flag of the free, the Stars-and-Bars,
symbol of slavery, flew above the surrendered
ship. The "Cumberland," going down with her
flag, had had the better fate of the two.</p>

<p>The "Merrimac," justly satisfied with her
day's work and with the toll she had taken of
the Union squadron, steamed proudly back to
Norfolk, to repair the slight damages she had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
suffered and to make ready to complete her
conquest on the morrow. Three Union ships
still lay in Hampton Roads, great frigates, the
finest of their kind then afloat, perfectly appointed,
fully manned,&mdash;and as useless as though
they had been the toy-boats of a child. The
"Minnesota," now the flagship, signaled Captain
Lawrence's stirring slogan: "Don't give up
the ship!" It might have been called a bit of
useless bravery, but no bravery is useless. At
least the officers and men of the three doomed
ships would fight for the flag until they died. It
was just possible that one of the three might
so maneuver that she would strike the foe
amidships and sink with her to a glorious
death.</p>

<p>That night the wild anxiety at Hampton
Roads was more than echoed at New York and
Washington. The wires had told the terrible
tale of the "Merrimac." It was thought she
could go straight to New York, sink all the
shipping there, command the city and levy
tribute upon it. Lincoln's Secretary of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Navy, Gideon Welles of Connecticut, wrote in
his diary that night: "The most frightened man
on that gloomy day was the Secretary of War.
He was at times almost frantic.... He ran
from room to room, sat down and jumped up
after writing a few words, swung his arms,
and scolded and raved." Hay records that
"Stanton was fearfully stampeded. He said
they would capture our fleet, take Fort Monroe,
be in Washington before night."</p>

<p>Without consulting the Secretary of the
Navy, Stanton had some fifty canal-boats loaded
with stone and sent them to be sunk on Kettle
Bottom Shoals, in the Potomac, to keep the
"Merrimac" from reaching Washington. The
canal-boats reached the Shoals, but the order to
sink them was countermanded by cooler heads.
They were left in a long row, tied up to the
river bank.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three doomed ships at Hampton Roads
soon knew that at nine o'clock of that fateful
night there had steamed in from the ocean a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Union iron-clad. Her coming, however, brought
scant comfort.</p>

<p>"What is she like?" asked the first captain
to hear the news.</p>

<p class="pmb2">"Like? She's like a cheese-box on a raft."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/illo_083.jpg" width="600" height="359" alt="THE BATTLE OF THE MONITOR AND THE MERRIMAC" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08">THE BATTLE OF THE &quot;MONITOR&quot; AND THE &quot;MERRIMAC&quot;</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">It was not a bad description. She was the
"Monitor," an unknown boat of an unknown
type that day, and on the morrow the most famous
fighting craft that ever sailed the seas.
She was born of the brain of a Swedish-American,
Capt. John Ericsson, whose statue
stands in Battery Park, the southern tip of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
metropolis, looking down to the ocean he saved
for freedom's cause.</p>

<p>Lieut. A. L. Worden, commanding the
"Monitor," was soon in consultation with the
other commanders. They scarcely tried to disguise
their belief that he had merely brought
another predestined victim. His ship was tiny,
compared with the "Merrimac." She was not
built to ram, as was her terrible antagonist.
Her guns were of a greater caliber, to be sure,
than any wooden ship mounted, but there were
but two of them and they could be brought to
bear only by revolving the "Monitor's" turret,&mdash;a
newfangled device in everyday use now, but
then unknown and consequently despised. Men
either fear or despise the unknown. They are
usually wrong in doing either. The council of
captains agreed upon a plan for the next day's
fight. The plan was based upon the theory that
the "Monitor" would be speedily sunk. Nevertheless,
she was to face the foe first of all.</p>

<p>Again the next morning came and again there
came the rebel ram. Decked out in flags as if
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
for a festival, proudly certain of victory, the
"Merrimac" steamed down Hampton Roads.
The cheese-box on a raft steamed out to meet
her. It was David confronting Goliath. Goliath
had fourteen guns and David had two. The
iron-clads came nearer and the most famous sea-duel
ever fought began. Tom saw it all from
the bridge of the "Minnesota." Both vessels
fired and fired again, without result. Their
armor defied even the big guns they carried.
Then the "Merrimac" tried to bring her deadly
ram into play. The "Monitor" dodged into
shoal water, hoping her foe would follow her
and run aground. The "Merrimac" did not
fall into the trap. On the contrary, she left her
adversary and made a headlong course for the
helpless "Minnesota." On board the latter,
drums beat to quarters, shrill whistles gave
orders, and the great ship moved forward to
what seemed certain destruction. But the
"Monitor" slipped away from the shoals and
made after the "Merrimac," firing her guns as
rapidly as her creaking turret could turn. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
"Merrimac" faced about, bound this time to
make short work of this wretched little gnat that
was seeking to sting her. This time the two
came to close grips. Each tried to ram the other
down. Each struck the other, but struck a
glancing blow. They lay almost alongside and
pounded each other with their giant guns. A
missile from the "Monitor" came through a
porthole of the "Merrimac," breaking a cannon
and dealing death and destruction within her
iron sides. She turned and ran for safety to the
shelter of the Confederate batteries at Norfolk.
The "Monitor" lay almost unharmed upon the
gentle waves of Hampton Roads, the ungainly
master of the seas. The "Merrimac" never
dared again to try conclusions with her stout
little rival. She stayed at her moorings until
she was blown up there just before the Union
forces captured Norfolk. The Union blockade
was never broken. The "Monitor" survived
the fight only to founder later in "the graveyard
of ships," off Cape Hatteras.</p>

<p>The wires had told the story of the famous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
fight before Tom reached Washington, but he
was the first eye-witness of it to reach there and
he had to tell the tale many and many a time.
His first auditors were Lincoln and Secretary
Welles. The dispatch boat that carried him
back put him on board the President's boat,
south of Kettle Bottom Shoals, on the Potomac,
in obedience to orders signaled to it. When he
had finished his story, there was silence for a
moment. The boy saw Lincoln's lips move, perhaps
in prayer, perhaps in thanksgiving. Then
the grave face relaxed and the pathetic eyes
twinkled with humor. The President laid his
hand upon the Secretary's arm and pointed to a
long line of stone-laden canal-boats that bordered
the bank.</p>

<p>"There's Stanton's navy," said Lincoln.</p>

<p class="pmb2">At the end of the next month, April, 1862,
Admiral Farragut gallantly forced open the
closed mouth of the Mississippi. He took his
wooden ships into action against forts and iron-clad
gunboats and captured New Orleans.
Within fifteen months thereafter, the North was
in practical control of the whole Mississippi.
By July, 1863, the Confederacy had been split
into two parts, east and west of the "Father of

the Mississippi. Farragut's fleet began the driving

<p class="p2">During that hour, a colored servant employed
in the White House, whose heart was blacker
than his sooty skin, had left the mansion, had
sought a tumble-down tenement in the slums,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and had found there a vulture of a man, very
white as to face, very black as to the masses of
hair that fell to his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Dat dar boy Strong, he's dun sure goin',"
said the darkey, "wid papers fur dat General
Grant out West."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Coz I listened to de door, when dey-uns wuz
a-talkin'."</p>

<p>"He'll have to go West by Baltimore," mused
the white man. "The next train leaves in half
an hour. I can make it. Here, Reub, here's
your pay."</p>

<p>He took a five-dollar gold piece from his
pocket. The negro clutched at it. Then what
was left of his conscience stirred within him.
He said, pleadingly, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Massa, you knows I'se doin' dis coz old
Massa told me to. You ain't a-goin' to hurt dat
boy Strong, is you? He's a nice boy. Eberybody
lubs him up dar."</p>

<p>"What is it to you, confound you!" snarled
the man, "whether I hurt him or not? What's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
a boy's life to winning the war? You keep on
doing what old Massa told you to do, or I'll cut
your black heart out."</p>

<p>With a savage gesture, he thrust the trembling
negro out of the dingy room. With
savage haste, he packed his scanty belongings.
With a pistol in his hip pocket, with a bowie-knife
slung over his left breast beneath his waistcoat,
with a vial of chloroform in his valise,
Wilkes Booth left Washington on the trail of
Tom Strong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hunter and hunted were in the same car.
Tom little dreamed that a few seats behind him
sat a deadly foe, who would stick at nothing to
get the precious papers he carried. Washington
swarmed with Confederate spies. The face
of everybody at the White House was well
known to every spy. The hunter did not have
to guess where the hunted sat.</p>

<p>General Grant had begun his career of victory
in the West. It was all-important to the Confederacy
to know where his next blow was to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
be aimed. The papers in the scout's possession
would tell that great secret. Wilkes Booth
meant to have those papers soon. As the train
bumped over the rough iron rails, towards Baltimore,
Booth went to the forward end of the car
for a glass of water and as he walked back along
the aisle with a slow, lounging step, he stopped
where Tom sat and held out his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Strong? I'm Mr.
Barnard. I have had the pleasure of seeing you
about the White House sometimes, when I have
been calling on our great President. Lincoln
will crush these accursed rebels soon!"</p>

<p>It was a trifle overdone, a trifle theatrical.
Wilkes Booth could never help being theatrical.
His greeting was one of the few times Tom had
ever been called "Mister." He felt flattered
and took the proffered hand willingly, but he
searched his memory in vain for any real recollection
of the striking face of the man who spoke
to him. There was some vague stirring of
memory about it, but certainly this had no relation
to that happy life at the White House.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Something evil was connected with it. Puzzled,
he wondered. He had seen Booth under arms at
John Brown's scaffold, but he did not remember
that.</p>

<p>The alleged Mr. Barnard slipped into the seat
beside him and began to talk. He talked well.
Little by little, suspicion fell asleep in Tom's
mind as his companion told of adventures on sea
and land. Booth was trying to seem to talk
with very great frankness, in order to lure Tom
into a similar frankness about himself. He
larded all his talk with protestations of fervent
loyalty to the Union. Tom bethought himself
of a favorite quotation his father often used
from Shakespeare's great play of "Hamlet."
The conscience-stricken queen says to Hamlet,
her son:</p>

<p>"The lady doth protest too much, methinks."</p>

<p>Wilkes Booth was protesting too much. The
drowsy suspicion in Tom's mind stirred again.
But he was but a boy and Booth was a man,
skilled in all the craft of the stage. Once more
his easy, brilliant talk lulled caution to sleep.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Tom, questioned so skillfully that he did not
know he was being drawn out, little by little
told the story of his short life. But the story
ended with his saying he was going to Harrisburg
"on business." He was still enough on his
guard not to admit he was going further than
Harrisburg.</p>

<p>"You're pretty young to be on the way to the
State Capitol on business," said the skillful
actor, hoping to hear more details in answer to
the half-implied sneer. But just then Tom remembered
what his father had advised: "Never
say anything to anybody, unless you are sure
the President would wish you to say it." He
shut up like a clam. Booth could get nothing
more out of him. But he meant to get those
dispatches out of him. They were either in the
boy's pocket or his valise, probably in his
pocket. When he fell asleep, the spy's time
would come. So the spy waited.</p>

<p>Darkness came. Two smoky oil-lamps gave
such light as they could. The train rumbled
on in the night. There were no sleeping cars
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
then. People slept in their seats, if they slept
at all. Booth's tones grew soothing, almost
tender. They served as a lullaby. Tom slept.
The spy beside him drew a long, triumphant
breath. His time had come.</p>

<p>Some time before, he had shifted his traveling-bag
to this seat. Now he drew from it,
gently, quietly, the little bottle of chloroform
and a small sponge, which he saturated with the
stupefying drug. Then he slipped his arm under
the sleeping boy's head, drew him a little closer
to himself, and glanced through the dusky car.
Nearly everybody was asleep. Those who were
not were trying to go to sleep. No one was
watching. Booth pressed the sponge to Tom's
nostrils. Tom stirred uneasily. "Sh-sh, Tom,"
purred the actor, "go to sleep; all's well." The
drug soon did its work. The boy was dead to the
world for awhile. Only a shock could rouse him.</p>

<p>The shock came. Booth's long, sensitive,
skilled fingers&mdash;the fingers of a musician&mdash;ransacked
his coat and waistcoat pockets swiftly,
finding nothing. But beneath the waistcoat
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
their tell-tale touches had detected the longed-for
papers. The waistcoat was deftly unbuttoned&mdash;it
could have been stripped off without
arousing the unconscious boy&mdash;and a triumphant
thrill shot through Booth's black heart as
he drew from an inner pocket the long, official
envelope that he knew must hold what he had
stealthily sought. He was just about to slip it
into his own pocket and then to leave his stupefied
victim to sleep off the drug while he himself
sought safety at the next station, when one of
those little things which have big results occurred.
The sturdy man who was snoring in the
seat behind this one happened to be a surgeon.
He was returning from Washington, whither he
had gone to operate on a dear friend, a wounded
officer. Chloroform had of course been used,
but the patient had died under the knife. It
had been a terrible experience for the operator.
It had made his sleep uneasy. A mere whiff
from the sponge Booth had used reached the
surgeon's sensitive nostril. It revived the
poignant memories of the last few hours. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
awoke with a start that brought him to his feet.
And there, just in front of him, he saw by the
dim light a boy sunk in stupefied slumber and
a man glancing guiltily back as he tried to thrust
a stiff and crackling paper into his pocket. The
sponge had fallen to the floor, but its fumes, far-spreading
now, told to the practiced surgeon a
story of foul play. He grabbed the man by
the shoulder and awoke most of the travelers,
but not Tom, with a stentorian shout: "What
are you doing, you scoundrel?"</p>

<p>The scoundrel leaped to his feet, throwing off
the doctor's hand, and sprang into the aisle,
clutching the long envelope in his left hand,
while his right held a revolver. He rushed for
the door, pursued by half a dozen men, headed
by the doctor. Close pressed, he whirled about
and leveled his pistol at his unarmed pursuers.
They fell back a pace. He whirled again, stumbled
over a bag in the aisle, fell, sprang to his
feet once more. A brakeman opened the door.
He was hurrying to see what this clamor meant.
Wilkes Booth fired at him pointblank. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
bullet missed, but it made the brakeman give
way. Booth rushed by him, gained the platform
and leaped from the slow train into the
sheltering night.</p>

<p>The shock that waked Tom was the sound of
the shot. Weak, dizzy, and sick, he knew only
that some terrible thing was happening. Instinctively,
his hand sought that inner pocket,
only to find it empty. Then, indeed, he was
wide awake. The horror of his loss burned
through his brain. He shouted: "Stop him!
Stop thief!" and collapsed again into his seat.</p>

<p>He was in fact a very sick boy. The dose of
chloroform that had been given him would have
been an overdose for a man. Notwithstanding
his awakening, he might have relapsed into
sleep and death, had not the skillful surgeon
been there to devote himself to him. An antidote
was forced down his throat. Willing volunteers,
for of course the whole car was now
awake in a hurly-burly of question and answer,
rubbed life back into him. When he was a bit
better, he was kept walking up and down the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
aisle, while two strong men held him up and
his head swayed helplessly from side to side.
But the final cure came when the surgeon who
had kept catlike watch upon him saw that he
could now begin to understand things.</p>

<p>"Here is something of yours," he whispered
into the lad's half-unconscious ear. "That scoundrel
stole it from you. When he fell, he must
have dropped it on the floor. I found it there
after he had jumped off the platform."</p>

<p>Tom's hand closed over the fateful envelope.
His trembling fingers ran along its edges. It
had not been opened. He had not betrayed his
trust. A profound thankfulness and joy stirred
within him. Within an hour he was practically
himself again. Then he poured out his heart
in thanks to the sturdy surgeon who had saved
not only his life, but his honor. He asked his
name and started at his reply:</p>

<p>"Dr. Hans Rolf, of York, Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>"Dr. Hans Rolf," repeated Tom, "but perhaps
you are the grandson of the Hans Rolf I've
heard about all my life. My father is always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
telling me of things Hans Rolf did for my
grandfather and great-grandfather."</p>

<p>"And what is <i>your</i> name?" queried the doctor,
surprised as may be imagined that this unknown
boy should know him so well.</p>

<p>"Tom Strong."</p>

<p>"By the Powers," shouted the hearty doctor,
seizing the boy's hand and wringing it as his
grandfather used to wring the hand of the Tom
Strongs he knew, "By the Powers, next to my
own name there's none I know so well as yours.
My grandfather never wearied of talking about
the two Tom Strongs, father and son. The last
day he lived, he told me how your great-grandfather
saved his life."</p>

<p>"And you know he saved great-grandfather's,
too," answered Tom, "and now you have saved
mine."</p>

<p>He looked shyly at his preserver. He was
still weak with the after-effects of the drug that
had been given him. The Hans Rolf he saw
was a bit blurred by the unshed tears through
which he saw him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the surgeon, "whatever
I've done is just in the day's work. But you
must stop at York and rest. I can't let my
patient travel just yet, you know. And this may
be your last chance to see me at home. I go
into the army next month."</p>

<p>However, Tom was not to be persuaded to
stop. Duty called him Westward and to the
West he went, as fast as the slow trains of those
days could carry him. But when Hans Rolf and
he parted, a few hours after they had met, they
were friends for life.</p>

<p class="pmb2">It took Tom two days to get from Harrisburg
to Cairo, the southernmost town in Illinois. It
lies at the junction of the Mississippi and Ohio
rivers. The latter pours a mass of beautiful blue
water&mdash;the early French explorers named the
Ohio "the beautiful river"&mdash;into the muddy
flood of the Mississippi. For miles below Cairo
the blue and yellow streams seem to flow side
by side. Then the yellow swallows the blue and
the mighty Mississippi rolls its murky way to
the Gulf of Mexico. A gunboat took the young
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
messenger from Cairo to General Grant's headquarters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/illo_102.jpg" width="600" height="244" alt="MISSISSIPPI RIVER GUNBOATS" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08">MISSISSIPPI RIVER GUNBOATS</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">A Western gunboat was an odd thing. James
B. Eads, an eminent engineer, who after the war
built the St. Louis bridge and the New Orleans
jetties, which keep the mouth of the Mississippi
open, had launched a flotilla of gunboats for
the government within four months of the time
when the trees which went to their making were
growing in the forests. On a flat-boat of the
ordinary Western-river type, Mr. Eads put a
long cabin, framed of stout timbers, cut portholes
in the sides, front and rear of it, mounted
cannon inside it, covered it with rails outside
(later armor-plate was used), and behold, a gunboat.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
The one which sped swiftly with Tom
down the Mississippi and waddled slowly with
him up the Tennessee, against the current of the
Spring freshets, finally landed him at Grant's
headquarters.</p>

<p>Tom approached the tent over which headquarters'
flag was flying with a beating heart.
It beat against the long envelope that lay in the
inner pocket of his waistcoat. He was about to
finish his task and he was about to see the one
successful soldier of the Union, up to that time.
The Northern armies had not done well in the
East&mdash;the defeat had been disgraceful and the
panic sickening with the raw troops at Bull Run,
Virginia, and little had been gained elsewhere&mdash;but
in the West Grant was hammering out success.
All eyes turned to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the top of a low knoll, half a dozen
packing-boxes were grouped in front of the
tent. Two or three officers, most of them spick
and span, sat upon each box except one. Upon
that one there lounged a man, thick-set,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
bearded, his faded blue trousers thrust into the
tops of dusty boots, his blue flannel shirt open
at the throat, his worn blue coat carrying on each
shoulder the single star of a brigadier-general.</p>

<p>It was General Grant, Hiram Ulysses Grant,
now known as U. S. Grant. When the Confederate
commander of Fort Donelson had asked
him for terms of surrender, he had answered
practically in two words: "unconditional surrender."
The curt phrase caught the public
fancy, and gave his initials a new meaning. He
was long known as "Unconditional Surrender"
Grant.</p>

<p>Born in Ohio, he had been educated at West
Point, had fought well in our unjust war against
Mexico, had resigned in the piping times of
peace that followed, had been a commercial
failure, and was running an insignificant business
as a farmer in Galena, Illinois, an obscure
and unimportant citizen of that unimportant
town, when the Civil War began. Eight
years afterwards, he became President of the
United States and served as such for eight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
years, doing his dogged best, but far less successful
as a statesman than he had been as a
soldier. He was a patriot and a good man. In
the last years of his life, ruined financially by a
wicked partner and tortured by the cancer that
finally killed him, he wrote his famous memoirs,
which netted his family a fortune after the
grave had closed upon this great American. He
ran a race with Death to write his life. And
he won the grim race.</p>

<p>The young second-lieutenant saluted and explained
his mission. The long envelope, deeply
dented with the mark of Wilkes Booth's dirty
thumb and finger, had reached its destination at
last. Grant took it, opened it, read it without
even a slight change of expression, though it
contained not only orders for the future, but
Lincoln's warm-hearted thanks for the past and
the news of his own promotion to be major-general.
Not only Tom, but every member of
his staff was watching him. The saturnine
face told no one anything. The little he said at
the moment was said to Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"The President tells me he would like to have
you given a glimpse of the front. Have you had
any experience?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"When were you commissioned?"</p>

<p>"A week ago, sir."</p>

<p>"Are all the Eastern boys of your age in the
army?"</p>

<p>"They would like to be, sir."</p>

<p>"Well," said Grant, with a kindly smile, "perhaps
a little experience at the front may make
up for the years you lack. Send him to General
Mitchell, Captain," he added, turning to a spruce
aide who rose from his packing-box seat to
acknowledge the command.</p>

<p>"Pray come with me, Mr. Strong," said the
captain.</p>

<p>Tom saluted, turned, and followed his guide.
A backward glance showed him the general, his
eyes now bent sternly upon Lincoln's letter, his
staff eyeing him, a group of quiet, silent figures.
And that was all that Tom saw, at that time,
of the greatest general of our Civil War.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Three days afterwards, Tom found himself
"on special service," on the staff of
Gen. O. M. Mitchell, whose troops were pushing
towards Huntsville, Alabama. They occupied
that delightfully sleepy old town, the center of
a group of rich plantations, April 12, 1862, but
Tom was not then with the column. Five days
before, with Mitchell's permission, he had volunteered
for a gallant foray into the enemy's
country. He had taken prompt advantage of
Lincoln's hint that he might fight a bit if he
wanted to do so. He was to have his fill of
fighting now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was one of twenty-two volunteers who
left camp before dawn on April 7, under the
command of James J. Andrews, a daredevil of a
man, who had persuaded General Mitchell to let
him try to slip across the lines with a handful
of soldiers disguised as Confederates in order
to steal a locomotive and rush it back to the
Union front, burning all the railroad bridges it
passed. The railroads to be crippled were those
which ran from the South to Chattanooga,
Tennessee, and from the East through Chattanooga
and Huntsville to Memphis. A few
miles from camp, Andrews gave his men their
orders. They were to separate and singly or in
groups of two or three were to make their way
to the station of Big Shanty, Georgia, where
they were to meet on the morning of Saturday,
April 12. Andrews took Tom with him. For
two days they hid in the wooded hills by day
and traveled by night, guided by a compass and
by the stars. Then their scanty supply of food
was exhausted and they had to take to the open.
Their rough clothing, stained a dusty yellow
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with the oil of the butternut, the chief dye-stuff
the South then had, their belts with
"C.S.A."&mdash;"Confederate States of America"&mdash;upon
them, their Confederate rifles (part of
the spoils of Fort Donelson), and their gray
slouched hats made them look like the
Confederate scouts they had to pretend
to be.</p>

<p>Danger lurked about them and detection
meant death. They did their best to talk in the
soft Southern drawl when they stopped at huts
in the hills and asked for food, but the drawl
was hard for a Northern tongue to master and
more than one bent old woman or shy and
smiling girl started with suspicion at the strange
accents of these "furriners." The men of the
hills were all in the army or all in hiding. On
the fourth day they reached a log-hut or rather
a home made of two log-huts, with a floored
and roofed space between them, a sort of open-air
room where all the household life went on
when good weather permitted. An old, old
woman sat in the sunshine, her hands busy with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a rag quilt, her toothless gums busy with holding
her blackened clay pipe. Behind her sat her
granddaughter, busy too with her spinning
wheel. The two women with their home as a
background made a pleasing and a peaceful
picture.</p>

<p>"Howdy," said Andrews.</p>

<p>The wheel stopped. The quilt lay untouched
upon the old woman's lap. She took her pipe
from her mouth.</p>

<p>"Howdy," said she.</p>

<p>The conversation stopped. The hill-folk are
not quick of speech.</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, may I have a drink of milk?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Sairey," called the old dame, "you git sum
milk."</p>

<p>Sairey started up from her spinning wheel, trying
to hide her bare feet with her short skirt
and not succeeding, and walked back of the
house to the "spring-house," a square cupboard
built over a neighboring spring. It was dark
and cool and was the only refrigerator the hill-folk
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
knew. While she was away, her grandmother
began to talk. The man and boy would
much rather she had kept still. For she peered
at them suspiciously, and said:</p>

<p>"How duz I know you uns ain't Yankees? I
hearn thar wuz a right smart heap o' Yankee
sojers not fur off'n hereabouts."</p>

<p>At this moment Sairey fortunately returned.
She brought in her brown hand an old glass
goblet, without a standard, but filled to the brim
with a foaming mixture that looked like delicious
milk. Alas! Tom, who loathed buttermilk,
was now to learn that in the hills "milk"
meant "buttermilk." He should have asked for
"sweet milk." Sairey handed him the goblet
with a shy grace, blushing a little as the boy's
hand touched hers. He lifted it eagerly to his
thirsty lips, took a long draught, and sputtered
and gagged. But the mistake was in his asking
and the girl had gone a hundred yards to get
him what she thought he wanted. He was a
boy, but he was a gentleman. He swallowed
the nauseous stuff to the last drop, and made his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
best bow as he thanked her. Suddenly the old
woman said to him:</p>

<p>"Where wuz you born, bub?"</p>

<p>"New&mdash;New&mdash;&mdash;" stammered Tom. His
tongue did not lend itself readily to a lie, even
in his country's cause. When he was still too
young to understand what the words meant, his
mother had told him: "A lie soils a boy's
mouth." As he grew older, she had dinned that
big truth into his small mind. Now, taken by
surprise, the habit of his young life asserted
itself and the tell-tale truth that he had been
born in New York was on his unsoiled lips,
when Andrews finished the sentence for him.</p>

<p>"New Orleans," said Andrews, coolly.</p>

<p>"He don't talk that-a-way," grumbled the old
beldam.</p>

<p>"He was raised up No'th," Andrews explained,
"but soon as this yer onpleasantness
began, he cum Souf to fight for we-uns."</p>

<p>Andrews had overdone his dialect.</p>

<p>"Sairey," commanded the old woman, "put
up the flag."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, granma," pleaded Sairey from where
she had taken refuge behind her grandmother's
chair, "what's the use?"</p>

<p>"Chile, you hear me? You put up the flag."</p>

<p>From her refuge, Sairey held out her hands
in a warning gesture, and then, before she entered
one of the log-houses, she pointed to a cart-track
that wound up the hill before the hut.
She came out with a Confederate flag, made of
part of an old red petticoat with white stripes
sewn across it. It was fastened upon a long
sapling. She put the staff into a rude socket in
front of the platform. As she passed Tom in
order to do this, she whispered to him: "You-uns
run!"</p>

<p>"What wuz you sayin' to Bub, thar?" her
grandmother asked in anger.</p>

<p>"I wuzn't sayin' nuthin' to nobuddy," Sarah
replied.</p>

<p>But Andrews' ears, sharper than the old
woman's, sharpened by fear, had caught the
words.</p>

<p>"We-uns'll haf to go," he remarked. "You-uns
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
haz bin right down good to us. Thanky,
ma'am."</p>

<p>"Jes' wait a minute," the old woman answered.
"I'll give you somethin' fer yer to eat
as ye mosey 'long."</p>

<p>She walked slowly, apparently with pain, into
the dark log-room. Sairey wrung her hand and
whispered: "Run, run. Take the cart-track."
Instantly the grandmother appeared on the
threshold, her old eyes flashing, a double-barreled
shot-gun in her shaking hands. She
tried to cover both man and boy, as she
screamed at them:</p>

<p>"You-uns stay in yer tracks, you Yankees!
My man'll know what to do with you-uns."</p>

<p>Their guns were at her feet. There was no
way to get them, even if they would have used
them against a woman.</p>

<p>"Run!" shouted Andrews and bounded towards
the cart-track.</p>

<p>Tom sprang after him, but not in time to
escape a few birdshot which the old woman's
gun sent flying after him. The sharp sting of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
them redoubled his speed. The second barrel
sent its load far astray. They had run just in
time, for from another hilltop behind the hut
a dozen armed men came plunging down to the
house, shouting after the scared fugitives. The
raising of the flag had been the agreed-upon
signal for their coming. Sairey's father and several
other men had taken to the nearby hills to
avoid being impressed into the Confederate
army, but they adored the Confederacy, up to
the point of fighting for it, and they would have
rejoiced to capture Andrews and Tom. The old
woman's eyes and ears had pierced the thin disguise
of the raiders. So she had forced her
granddaughter to fly the flag and the girl, afraid
to disobey her fierce old grandmother but loath
to see the boy she had liked at first sight captured,
had warned him to flee. Man and boy
were out of gunshot, but still in sight, when
their pursuers reached the house, yelled with
joy to see the abandoned guns, and ran up the
cart-track like hounds hot upon the scent. As
Tom and Andrews panted to the hilltop, they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
saw why Sairey had bidden them take the cart-track.
At the summit, it branched into half a
dozen lanes which wound through a pine forest.
Lanes and woodlands were covered with pineneedles,
the deposit of years, which rose elastic
under their flying feet and left no marks by
which they could be tracked. And beyond the
forest was a vast laurel-brake in which a regiment
could have hidden, screened from discovery
save by chance. It gave the fugitives shelter
and safety. Once they heard the far-off voices
of their pursuers, but only once. Ere many
hours they had the added security of the night.</p>

<p>When they found a hiding-place, beside a tiny
brook that flowed at the roots of the laurel-bushes,
Tom found that his wound, forgotten in
the fierce excitement of the flight, had begun to
pain him. His left shoulder grew stiff. When
Andrews examined it, all it needed was a little
care. Three or four birdshot had gone through
clothing and skin, but they lay close beneath the
skin, little blue lumps, with tiny smears of red
blood in the skin's smooth whiteness. They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
were picked out with the point of a knife. The
cool water of the brook washed away the blood
and stopped the bleeding. Andrews tore off a
bit of his own shirt, soaked it in the brook, and
bandaged the shoulder in quite a good first-aid-to-the-injured
way. Tom and he were none the
worse, except for the loss of their guns. And
that was the less serious because both knives
and pistols were still in their belts.</p>

<p>They slept that night in the laurel-brake, forgetting
their hunger in the soundness of their
sleep. Just after dawn, they were startled to
hear a human voice. But it was the voice of a
gentle girl. It kept calling aloud "Coo, boss,
coo, boss," while every now and then it said in
lower tones: "Is you Yanks hyar? Hyar's
suthin' to eat." At first they thought it was a
trap and lay still. Finally, however, spurred by
hunger, they crept out of their hiding-place and
found it was Sairey who was calling them.
When she saw them, she ran towards them,
while the cows she had collected from their pasture
stared with dull amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is you-uns hurt?" she asked, clasping her
hands in anxiety.</p>

<p>Reassured as to this, she produced the cold
cornbread and bacon she had taken from
the spring-house when she left home that
morning for her daily task of gathering the
family cows. Man and boy bolted down the
food.</p>

<p>"You're good to us, Sairey," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Dunno as I ought to help you-uns," the girl
replied, peering slyly out of her big sunbonnet
and digging her brown toes into the earth, "but
I dun it, kase&mdash;kase&mdash;I jes' had to. Kin you
get away today?"</p>

<p>"We'll try."</p>

<p>"Whar be you goin'?"</p>

<p>Should they tell her where they were going?
It was a risk, but they took it. They were glad
they did, for Sairey was not only eager to help
them on their way, but could be of real aid.
Once in her life she had been at Big Shanty.
She told them of a short cut through the hills,
by which they would pass only one "settle<i>mint</i>,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
as the infrequent clearings in the hills
were called.</p>

<p>"When you-uns git to Old Man Tomblin's
settle<i>mint</i>," said Sairey, "I 'low you-uns better
stand at the fence corner and holler. Old Man
Tomblin's spry with his gun sometimes, when
furriners don't do no hollerin'. But when he
comes out, you-uns tell him Old Man Gernt's
Sairey told you he'd take care of you-uns.
'N he will. 'N you kin tell Bud Tomblin&mdash;no,
you-uns needn't tell Bud nothin'. Good-by."</p>

<p>The hill-girl held out her hand. She looked up
to Andrews and smiled as she shook hands. She
looked down at Tom&mdash;she was half a head taller
than he&mdash;and smiled again as she shook hands.
Then suddenly she stooped and kissed the
startled boy. Then she fled back along the lane
by which she had come, leaving the placid cows
and the thankful man and boy behind her. With
a flutter of butternut skirt and a twinkle of bare,
brown feet, she vanished from their sight.</p>

<p>Thanks to her directions, they found Old Man
Tomblin's settle<i>mint</i> without difficulty. They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
duly stood at the corner of the sagging rail fence
and there duly "hollered." Old Man Tomblin
and Bud Tomblin came out of the cabin, each
with a gun, and were proceeding to study the
"furriners" before letting them come in, when
Andrews repeated what Old Man Gernt's Sairey
had told them to say. There was an instant
welcome. Bud Tomblin was even more anxious
than his father to do anything Sairey Gernt
wanted done. The fugitives' story that they had
been scouting near General Mitchell's line of
march and had lost their guns and nearly lost
themselves in a raid by Northern cavalry was
accepted without demur. Old Mrs. Tomblin,
decrepit with the early decrepitude of the hill-folk,
whose hard living conditions make women
old at forty and venerable at fifty, cackled a
welcome to them from the corner of the fireplace
where she sat "dipping" snuff. "Lidy"
Tomblin, the eldest daughter, helped and hindered
by the rest of a brood of children, took
care of their comfort. They feasted on the best
the humble household had to offer. They slept
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
soundly, albeit eight other people, including Mr.
and Mrs. Tomblin and Lidy, slept in the same
room. In the morning they were given a bountiful
breakfast and were bidden good-by as old
friends.</p>

<p>"I hate to deceive good people like the
Tomblins," said Tom, when they were out of
earshot.</p>

<p>"Sometimes the truth is too precious to be
told," laughed Andrews.</p>

<p>But Tom continued to be troubled in mind as
he tramped along. He made up his mind to
fight for his country, the next time he had a
chance, in some other way. Telling a lie and
living a lie were hateful to him.</p>

<p>The next morning found them at Big Shanty,
a tiny Georgia village, which the war had made
a great Confederate camp. It was the appointed
day, Saturday, April 12, 1862. Of the twenty-two
men who had started with Andrews,
eighteen met that morning at Big Shanty. The
train for Chattanooga stopped there for breakfast
on those infrequent days when it did not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
arrive so late that its stop was for dinner. It
was what is called a "mixed" train, both freight
and passenger, with many freight cars following
the engine and a tail of a couple of shabby
passenger cars. On this particular morning it
surprised everybody, including its own train-crew,
by being on time. Passengers and crew
swarmed in to breakfast. The train was deserted.
The time for the great adventure had
come.</p>

<p>Before the train was seized, one thing must
be done. The telegraph wire between Big
Shanty and Chattanooga must be cut. If this
were left intact, their flight, sure to be discovered
as soon as the train-crew finished their brief
breakfast, would end at the next station, put on
guard by a telegram. To Tom, as the youngest
and most agile of the party, the task of cutting
the wire had been assigned. He was already at
the spot selected for the attempt, a clump of
trees a hundred yards from the station, where
the wire was screened from sight by the foliage.
As soon as the train came in, Tom started to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
climb the telegraph-pole. He had just started
when he heard a most unwelcome sound.</p>

<p>"Hey, thar! What's you doin'?"</p>

<p>He turned his head and saw a Confederate
sentry close beside him. He recognized him as
a man with whom he had been chatting around
a camp-fire early that morning. His name was
Bill Coombs. Tom's ready wit stood by him.</p>

<p>"Why, Bill," he said, "glad to see you.
Somethin's wrong with the wire. The Cunnel's
sent me to fix it. Give me a boost, will ye?"</p>

<p class="pmb2">The unsuspicious Bill gave him a boost and
watched him without a thought of his doing
anything wrong while Tom climbed to the top
of the rickety pole, cut the one wire it carried,
fastened the ends to the pole so that from the
ground nobody could tell it was cut, and
climbed down. Bill urged him to stay and talk
awhile, but Tom reminded him that sentries
mustn't talk, then he strolled at first and soon
ran towards the station. He had to run to catch
the train. The instant Andrews saw him returning,
he sprang into the cab of the locomotive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/illo_124.jpg" width="600" height="337" alt="The locomotive Tom helped to steal" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08 smcap">The Locomotive Tom Helped to Steal</span>
</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>One of his men had already uncoupled the first
three freight cars from the rest of the train. All
the men jumped into the cab or the tender or
swarmed up the freight-car ladders. Andrews
jerked the throttle wide open. The engine
jumped forward, the tender and the three cars
bounding after it. The crowd upon the platform
gaped after the retreating train, without the
slightest idea of what was happening under their
very noses. A boy came running like an antelope
from the end of the platform. He jumped
for the iron step of the locomotive, was clutched
by a half-dozen hands and drawn aboard. But
as he jumped, he heard a voice he had reason
to remember call out:</p>

<p>"They're Yanks. That's Lieutenant Strong,
a Yankee! Stop 'em! Shoot 'em!"</p>

<p>Livid with rage, his long black hair streaming
in the wind as he ran after them, Wilkes Booth
fired his pistol at them, while the motley crowd
his cry had aroused sent a scattering volley
after the train. Nobody was hurt then, but the
danger to everybody had just begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>There was instant pursuit. The train-crew,
startled by the sound of the departing train,
came running from the station. They actually
started to run along the track after the flying
locomotive. They jerked a hand-car off a siding
and chased the fugitives with that. At a station
not far off, they found a locomotive lying with
steam up. They seized that and thundered
ahead. Now hunters and hunted were on more
even terms. The hunters reached Kingston,
Georgia, within four minutes after the hunted
had left. The latter had had to make frequent
stops, to cut the wires, to take on fuel, to bundle
into the freight cars ties that could be used to
start fires for the burning of bridges, and to tear
up an occasional rail. This last expedient delayed
their pursuers but little. When a missing
rail was sighted, the Confederates stopped, tore
up a rail behind them, slipped it into the vacant
place, and rushed ahead again.</p>

<p>Andrews was running the captured train on
its regular time schedule, so he could not exceed
a certain speed. From Kingston, however,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
where the only other train of the day met this
one, he expected a free road and plenty of time
to burn every bridge he passed. He did meet
the regular train at Kingston, but alas! it carried
on its engine a red flag. That meant that
a second section of the same train was coming
behind it. There was nothing to do but to wait
for this second section. The railroad was single-track,
so trains could pass only where there was
a siding. But in every moment of waiting there
lurked the danger of detection. Southerners,
soldiers, and civilians, crowded about the locomotive
as she lay helplessly still on the Kingston
sidetrack, puffing away precious steam and precious
time.</p>

<p>"Whar's yer passengers?" asked one man.
"I cum hyar to meet up with Cunnel Tompkins.
Whar's he'n the rest of 'em?"</p>

<p>"We were ordered to drop everything at Big
Shanty," explained Andrews, "except these
three cars. They're full of powder. I'm on
General Beauregard's staff and am taking the
stuff to him at Corinth. Jove, there's the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
whistle of the second section. I'm glad to
hear it."</p>

<p>He was indeed glad. At one of his stops, he
had bundled most of his men into the freight
cars. The cars were battered old things without
any locks. If a carelessly curious hand were
to slide back one of the doors and reveal within,
not powder, but armed men, all their lives would
pay the forfeit. Andrews was in the cab with
engineer, fireman, and Tom, who had been
helping the fireman feed wood into the maw
of the furnace on every mile of the run. His
young back ached with the strain of the unaccustomed
toil. His young neck felt the touch
of the noose that threatened them all.</p>

<p>"Tom, you run ahead and throw that switch
for us as soon as the other train pulls in," said
Andrews. "We mustn't keep General Beauregard
waiting for this powder a minute longer
than we can help. He needs it to blow the Yankees
to smithereens."</p>

<p>So Tom ran ahead, stood by the switch as
the second section came in, and promptly threw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the switch as it passed. But his train did not
move and a brakeman jumped off the rear platform
of the caboose of the second section, as it
slowed down, told Tom he was an ass and a
fool, pushed him out of the way and reset the
switch.</p>

<p>"You plum fool," shouted the brakeman,
after much stronger expressions, "didn't ye see
the flag fur section three?"</p>

<p>Tom had not seen it, had not looked for it,
but it was too true that the engine of section
two also bore the red flag that meant that section
three was coming behind it.</p>

<p>Again there was a long wait, again the sense
of danger closing in upon them, again the
thought of scaffold and rope, again the necessity
of playing their parts with laughter and good-natured
chaff amid the foes who thought them
friends. The slow minutes ticked themselves
away. At last the third section came whistling
and lumbering in. Thank fortune, it bore no red
flag. This time Tom threw the switch unchecked
and then jumped on the puffing engine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
as she reached the main-track and sped onwards.</p>

<p>"Free, by Jove!" said Andrews, with a deep
breath of deep relief. "Now we can burn
Johnny Reb's bridges for him!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four minutes later, while section three of the
train that had so long delayed them was still at
Kingston, a shrieking locomotive rushed into
the station. Its occupants, shouting a story of
explanation that put Kingston into a frenzy,
ran from it to an engine that lay upon a second
sidetrack, steam up and ready to start. They
had reached Kingston so speedily by using their
last pint of water and their last stick of wood.
They saved precious minutes by changing
engines.</p>

<p>Five seconds after their arrival, the station-agent
had been at the telegraph-key, frantically
pounding out the call of a station beyond Andrews's
fleeing train. There was no reply.</p>

<p>"Wire cut!" he shouted, running out of the
station. Of course that had been done by the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
fugitives just out of sight of Kingston. "Wire
cut! I kain't git no message through."</p>

<p>"We'll take the message!" answered the
Confederate commander, from the cab of the
locomotive that was already swaying with her
speed, as she darted ahead.</p>

<p>They came near delivering the message within
four miles of Kingston. Andrews's men, with a
most comforting sense of safety had stopped
and were pulling up a rail, when they heard the
whistle of their avenging pursuer.</p>

<p>"Quick, boys, all aboard," Andrews called.
"They're closer'n I like to have 'em."</p>

<p>Quickly replacing the rail, the Confederates
came closer still. Around the next curve, quite
hidden from sight until close upon it, the fugitives
had put a rail across the track. It delayed
the pursuit not one second. Whether the cowcatcher
of the engine thrust it aside or broke it
or whether the engine actually jumped it, nobody
knew then in the wild excitement of the
chase and nobody knows now. The one thing
certain is that there was no delay. Very likely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the rail broke. Rails of those days were of iron,
not steel, and throughout the South they were
in such condition that at the close of the Civil
War one of the chief Southern railroads was said
to consist of "a right-of-way and two streaks
of rust." The locomotive whistled triumphantly
and sped on.</p>

<p>On the Union train, Tom had crept back to
the rear car along the rolling, jumping carroofs,
with orders to set it on fire and stand
ready to cut it off. The men inside arranged a
pile of ties, thrust fat pine kindling among them,
and touched the mass with a match. It burst
into flame as they scuttled to the roof and
passed to the car ahead. A long covered
wooden bridge loomed up before them. Halfway
across it, Andrews stopped, dropped the
flaming car, and started ahead again. In a very
few minutes the bridge would have been a burning
mass, but the few minutes were not to be
had. The Confederate locomotive was now
close upon them. It dashed upon the bridge,
drove the burning car across the bridge before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
it, pushed it upon a neighboring sidetrack and
again whistled triumphantly as it took up the
fierce chase. The two remaining cars were detached,
one by one, but in vain. The game
was up.</p>

<p>"Guess we're gone," said Andrews, tranquilly,
as he looked back over the tender, now almost
empty of wood, to the smokestack that was
belching sooty vapor within a mile of them.
"By this time, they've got a telegram ahead of
us. Stop 'round that next curve in those woods.
We must take to the woods. Don't try to keep
together. Scatter. Steer by the North Star.
Make the Union lines if you can. We've done
our best."</p>

<p>The engine checked its mad pace, slowed,
stopped.</p>

<p>"Good-by, boys," shouted Andrews, as he
sprang from the engine and disappeared in the
forest that there bordered the track. "We'll
meet again."</p>

<p>Seven of them did meet him again. It was
upon a Confederate scaffold, where he and they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
were hung. The other six of the fourteen who
were captured were exchanged, a few months
later. Three others reached the Union lines
within a fortnight, unhurt. But where was Tom
Strong?</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Tom up a Tree&mdash;Did the Confederate Officer
See Him?&mdash;A Fugitive Slave Guides Him&mdash;Buying
a Boat in the Dark&mdash;Adrift in the
Enemy's Country.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first, Tom was up a tree. When he
jumped from the abandoned locomotive,
his mind was working as quickly as his body.
He reasoned that the Confederates would expect
them all to run as fast and as far away as
they could; that they would run after them;
that they would very probably catch him, utterly
tired out as he was, so tired that even fear
could not lend wings to his leaden feet; that the
pursuit, however, would not last long, because
the Confederates would wish to reach a station
soon, in order both to report their success and
to send out a general alarm and so start a general
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
search for the fugitives; and that he would
best hide as near at hand as might be. In other
words, he thought, quite correctly, that the best
thing to do is exactly what your enemy does
not expect you to do. He picked out a big oak
tree quite close to the track, its top a mass of
thick-set leaves such as a Southern April brings
to a Southern oak. He climbed it, nestled into
a sheltered crotch high above the ground, and
waited. He did not have to wait long. He
could still hear the noise of his comrades plunging
through the woods when the Confederate
engine drew up beneath his feet. Before it
stopped, the armed men who clustered thick
upon locomotive and tender were on the ground
and running into the woods. A gallant figure
in Confederate gray led them. He heard the
rush of them, then a shot or two, exultant yells,
and ere long the tramp of returning feet. They
came back in half a dozen groups, bringing with
them three of his comrades in flight, less fortunate
than he, at least less fortunate up to that
time. Andrews was one of the prisoners. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
had slipped and fallen, had strained a sinew, and
had lain helpless until his pursuers reached him.
Tom, peering cautiously through his leafy
shelter, saw that his late leader was limping and
was held upright by a kindly Confederate, who
had passed his arm about him.</p>

<p>"'Tain't fur," said his captor, cheerily,
"hyar's the injine."</p>

<p>"The Yank's goin' fur," sneered a soldier of
another kind, "he's goin' to Kingdom Cum,
blast him!" He lifted his fist to strike the helpless
man, but the young officer in command
caught the upraised arm.</p>

<p>"None of that," he said, sternly. "Americans
don't treat prisoners that way. You're
under arrest. Put down your gun and climb
into the tender. Do it now and do it quick."
Sulkily the brute obeyed. "Lift him in," went
on the officer to the man who was supporting
Andrews. This was gently done. The other
two captives climbed in. So did the Confederates.
Their officer turned to them.</p>

<p>"You've done your duty well," he said.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
"You've been chasing brave men. They've
done their duty well too.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'For such a gallant feat of arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never seen before.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tom started with surprise. The young officer
was quoting from Macaulay's "Lays of Ancient
Rome." The boy had stood beside his mother's
knee when she read him the "Lays" and had
often since read them himself.</p>

<p>That start of surprise had almost been Tom's
undoing. He had rustled the leaves about him.
A tiny shower of pale green things fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Captain, there's somebody up that tree,"
said a soldier, pointing straight at the point
where Tom sat. "I heard him rustle."</p>

<p>The captain looked up. The boy always
thought the officer saw him and spared him,
partly because of his youth&mdash;he knew the fate
the prisoners faced&mdash;and partly because of his
admiration for "the gallant feat of arms." Be
that as it may, he certainly took no step just
then to make another prisoner. Instead he
laughed and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's a 'possum. We haven't time for a
coon-hunt just now. Get ahead. We'll send an
alarm from the next station and so bag all the
Yankees."</p>

<p>The engine, pushing the recaptured one before
it, started and disappeared around the end
of the short curve upon which Andrews had
made his final stop. For the moment at least,
Tom was safe. But he knew the hue-and-cry
would sweep the country. Everybody would be
on the lookout for stray Yankees. And as
everybody would think the estrays were all
going North, Tom decided to go South. He slid
down the tree, looked at his watch, studied the
sunlight to learn the points of the compass, drew
his belt tighter to master the hunger that now
assailed him, and so began his southward tramp,
a boy, alone, in the enemy's country.</p>

<p>That part of Georgia is a beautiful country
and Tom loved beauty, but it did not appeal to
him that afternoon. He was hungry; he was
tired; the excitement that had upheld him
through the hours of flight on the captured
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
engine was over. He plodded through a little
belt of forest and found himself in a broad valley,
with a ribbon of water flowing through it.
He stumbled across plowed fields to the little
river. A dusty road, with few marks of travel,
meandered beside the stream. He was evidently
near no main highway. Not far away a
planter's home, with a stately portico, gleamed
in the sunlight through its screen of trees. In
the distance lay a little village. There was food
in both places and he must have food. To which
should he go? It was decided for him that he
was to go to neither. As he slipped down the
river bank, to quench his burning thirst and to
wash his dusty face and hands, he almost
stepped upon a negro who lay full length at the
foot of the bank, hidden behind a tree that had
been uprooted by the last flood and left stranded
there. The boy was scared by the unexpected
meeting, but not half as much as the
negro.</p>

<p>"Oh, Massa," said the negro, on his knees
with outstretched hands, "don' tell on me,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Massa. I'll be your slabe, Massa. Jes' take me
with you. Please don't tell on me. You kin
make a lot o' money sellin' me, Massa. Please
lemme go wid you."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Morris, Massa."</p>

<p>"Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"From dat house, Massa." He pointed to
the big house nearby.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>Little by little, Morris (reassured when he
found Tom was a Northern soldier and like himself
a fugitive) told his story. He had been
born on this plantation. Reared as a house-servant,
he could read a little. He had learned
from the newspapers his master took that a
Northern army was not far away. He made up
his mind to try for freedom. His master kept
dogs to track runaways, but no dog can track
a scent in running water. It was not probable
his flight would be discovered until after nightfall.
So he had stolen to his hiding-place in the
afternoon, intending to wade down the tiny
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
stream as soon as darkness came. Two miles
below, the stream merged itself into a larger
one. There he hoped to steal a boat, hide by
day and paddle by night until he reached the
Tennessee. "Dat ribber's plum full o' Massa
Lincum's gunboats," he assured Tom.</p>

<p>"How are you going to live on the journey?"
asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I spec' dey's hen-roosts about," quoth Morris
with a chuckle, "and I'se got a-plenty to eat
to start wid. Dis darkey don' reckon to starve
none."</p>

<p>"Give me something to eat, quick!"</p>

<p>Morris willingly produced cornpone and
bacon from a sack beside him. Tom wanted to
eat it all, but he knew these precious supplies
must be kept as long as possible, so he did not
eat more than half of them. The two agreed
to keep together in their flight for freedom. As
soon as it was dark, they began their wading.
The two miles seemed an endless distance. The
noises of the night kept their senses on the
jump. Once a distant bloodhound's bay scared
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Morris so much that his white teeth clattered
like castanets. Once the "too-whit-too" of a
nearby owl sent Tom into an ecstasy of terror.
He fairly clung to Morris, who, just ahead of
him, was guiding his steps through the shallow
water. When he found he had been scared by
an owl, he was so ashamed that he forced himself
to be braver thereafter. At last they
reached their first goal, the larger river. Here
Morris's knowledge of the ground made him
the temporary commander of the expedition.
He knew of a little house nearby, the home of
a "poor white," who earned part of his precarious
livelihood by fishing. Morris knew just
where he kept his boat. There was no light in
the little house and no sound from it as they
crept stealthily along the bank to the tree where
the boat was tied. Tom drew his knife to cut
the rope.</p>

<p>"No, Massa," whispered Morris. "Not dat-a-way.
Ef it's cut, dey'll know it's bin tuck and
dey'll s'picion us. Lemme untie it. Den dey'll
t'ink it's cum loose and floated away. 'N dey'll
     <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
not hurry after it. Dey'll t'ink dey kin fin' it in
some cove any time tomorrer."</p>

<p>Morris was right. It did not take him long
to untie the clumsy knot. Three oars and some
fishing-tackle lay in the flat-bottomed boat.
They got into it, pushed off, and floated down
the current without a sound. Morris steered
with an oar at the stern. Once out of earshot,
they rowed as fast as the darkness, intensified
by the shadows of the overhanging trees, permitted.</p>

<p>Just before they had pushed off, Tom had
asked:</p>

<p>"What is this boat worth, Morris?"</p>

<p>"Old Massa paid five dollars fer a new one
jest like it, dis lastest week."</p>

<p>Tom's conscience had told him that even
though a fugitive for his life in the enemy's
country he ought not to take the "poor
white's" boat without paying for it. He unbuttoned
an inside pocket in his shirt and drew out
a precious store of five-dollar gold pieces.
There were twenty of them, each wrapped in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
tissue-paper and the whole then bound together
in a rouleau, wrapped in water-proofed silk, so
that there would be no sound of clinking gold
as he walked. He figured that the three oars
and the sorry fishing tackle could not be worth
more than the boat was, so he took out two
coins and put them in a battered old pan that
lay beside the stump to which the boat was tied.
There the "cracker"&mdash;another name for the
"poor white"&mdash;would be sure to see them in the
morning. As a matter of fact he did. And they
were worth so much more than his vanished
property that he was inclined to think an angel,
rather than a thief, had passed that way. Tom's
conscientiousness spoiled Morris's plan of having
the owner think the boat had floated away,
but the "cracker" was glad to clutch the gold
and start no hue-and-cry. He was afraid that if
he recovered his boat, he would have to give up
the gold. It was much cheaper to make
another. So he kept still.</p>

<p>And still, very still, the fugitives kept as they
paddled slowly down the stream until the first
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
signs of dawn sent them into hiding. They hid
the boat in the tall reeds that fringed the mouth
of a tiny creek and they themselves crept a few
yards into the forest, ate very much less than
they wanted to eat of what was left of Morris's
scanty store of food, and went to sleep. They
slept until&mdash;but that is another story.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They slept until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Then Morris woke up with a yell. A dog's
cold nose was thrusting itself against his cheek.
He thought his master's bloodhounds were upon
him and that the whipping-post was the least he
had to fear. As Tom, startled from sound sleep
by the negro's scream of terror, sprang to his
feet, he saw Morris crouching upon the ground,
babbling "Sabe me, good Lord, sabe old Morris!"
The dog, a big black-and-yellow mongrel,
a very distant cousin of the bloodhound the
scared darkey imagined him to be, was looking
with a grieved surprise at the cowering man.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
He was a most good-natured beast, accustomed
to few caresses and many kicks, and he had
never before seen a man who was afraid of him.
As he turned to Tom, he saw a boy who wasn't
afraid of him. Tom, who had always been loved
by dogs and children, smiled at the big yellow
mongrel, said "Come here, old fellow," and in
an instant had the great hound licking his hand
and looking up to him with the brown-yellow
eyes full of a dog's faith and a dog's fidelity.
These are great qualities. A cynic once said:
"The more I see of men the more I like dogs."
That cynic probably got from men what he gave
to them. But still it is true that the unfaltering
faith of a dog and a child, once their confidence
has been won, is a rare and a precious thing.
Tom patted his new friend's head. The big tail
wagged with joy. The hound looked reproachfully
at Morris, as much as to say: "See how
you misunderstood me; I want to be friends: but
here"&mdash;he turned and looked at the boy who
was smiling at him&mdash;"here is my best friend."</p>

<p>He stayed with them an hour, contented and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
happy, humbly grateful for a tiny piece of meat
they gave him. Then, as dark drew near, he
became uneasy. Two or three times he started
as if to leave them, turned to see whether they
were following him, looked beseechingly at
them, barked gently, put his big paw on Tom's
arm and pulled at him. Evidently he wanted
them to come with him, but this they did not
dare to do.</p>

<p>"Ef we lets him go, he'll bring his folkses
here," Morris whispered.</p>

<p>"I suppose we must tie him up," Tom reluctantly
assented. "I hate to treat him that
way, for he's a good dog. But if we leave him
tied and push off in the boat, he'll howl after a
while and his master will find him. Take a bit
of fishing-line and tie him."</p>

<p>Morris turned towards the hidden boat, but
the hound, as if aware of what they had said,
suddenly started for his hidden home and vanished
into the underbrush before Tom could
catch hold of him. When Tom called, he
stopped once and looked back, but he did not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
come back. He shouldered his way into the
bushes and trotted off, with that amusing air
of being in a hurry to keep a most important
appointment which all dogs sometimes show.
And as he started, Morris appeared again, with
a shrill whisper: "De boat's dun sunk hisself."</p>

<p>Tom ran to the bank of the creek. The news
was too true. The boat had sunk. The rotten
caulking had dropped from one of the rotten
seams. The bow, tied to a tree in the canebrake,
was high in air. The stern was under
five feet of water. The oars had floated away.
The fishing-pole was afloat, held to the old craft
by the hook-and-line, which had caught in the
sunken seat. What were they to do? They felt
as a Western trapper used to feel, when he had
lost his horse and saw himself compelled to
make his perilous way on foot through a country
swarming with savage foes. What to do?</p>

<p>"We must raise the boat, Morris, get her on
shore, turn her over, caulk her with something,
make some paddles somehow and get off."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>They did, by great effort and with much more
noise than they liked to make, drag the crazy
old craft upon the bank of the creek. They
turned her bottom-side up. The negro plucked
down a long, waving mass of Spanish moss from
a cypress that grew in the swampy soil. Children
in the South call this Spanish moss "old
men's gray beards." Each long drift of it looks
as if it might have grown on the chin of an aged
giant. They were pressing it into the gaping
seam with feverish haste, listening the while for
any sign of that dreaded coming of the big
hound's "folkses." The short twilight of Southern
skies ended. A deep curtain of darkness fell
upon them. And through it they heard the
nearby patter of the dog's paws and the
shuffling footfalls of a man. And they saw the
gleam of a lantern.</p>

<p>"We'se diskivered, Massa Tom," old Morris
whispered, "we'se diskivered."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he slipped over the bank into the
creek and lay in much his attitude when Tom
had first "diskivered" him, except that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
water covered all of him except mouth and nose
and eyes. Tom bent down to him.</p>

<p>"Hush," he said, "keep still. There's only
one man coming. The dog's all right. I'll meet
the man. You stay here."</p>

<p>Then he stepped into a circle of light cast by
the lantern upon a mass of underbrush and
said, with a cheerful confidence he did not
feel:</p>

<p>"Howdy, neighbor?"</p>

<p>The big yellow dog was fawning at his feet
in a second. A quavering old voice came from
behind the light of the lantern.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Massa," it said. "Is I intrudin' on
you?"</p>

<p>An old, old negro shambled up to him, the
lantern in one hand, a ragged hat in another.
He bowed his crown of white kinky hair respectfully
before the white boy. There was no
enemy to be feared here. The boy's heart
bounded with relief and he laughed as he answered:</p>

<p>"No, Uncle, you're not intruding. I'm glad to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
see you. I'm sure you'll help us. Come here,
Morris."</p>

<p>Morris scrambled up the bank, the wettest
man in the world. His eyeballs shone as he
neared them. They shone still more as he stood
before the old negro, held out his hand, and said:</p>

<p>"Unk' Moses, I'se po'erful glad to meet up
wid you."</p>

<p>Uncle Moses almost dropped his rude lantern
in his surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, ef it ain't Massa Pinckney's Morris!
Howdy, Morris? How cum so as you-uns is
here, a-hidin'? I know'd de way dat ar Towser
wuz a-actin' when he dun cum home dat dere
wuz sum-un in de bush out hyar, but I neber
s'picioned t'wuz you, Morris. Is you dun run
away?"</p>

<p>The situation was soon explained. Uncle
Moses had already become familiar with it.
Hunted men, both white and black, were no
novelty to him by that time. He had helped
many of them on their scared way. Too old to
work, he lived alone in a little cabin on the outskirts
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of his owner's plantation. He tilled a tiny
plot of vegetables when "de rumatiz" permitted
and with these and some rations from
"de big house" he eked out a scanty living.
This owner's self-respect had not prevented his
working Moses through all a long life, with no
payment except food and lodging, and behind
these always the shadow of the whip. But the
slave's self-respect required him to work for the
hand that fed him, so long as failing strength
permitted. All he could do now was to scare
crows from the cornfield, but that he could do
well, for his one suit of the ragged remains of
what had been several other people's clothes
made him a perfect scarecrow. Besides his
vegetables, he had some chickens, a sacred possession.
"Old Unk' Mose" was known and respected
through all the countryside. No
chicken-thief ever came to his cabin. The kind
old patriarch was reaping the reward of a kind
long life. He dwelt in peace.</p>

<p>He took Tom and Morris to the lonely cabin
and treated them there with a royal hospitality.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Despite his protests, Tom was obliged to take
the one bed. Unk' Mose and Morris slept upon
the floor. First, they had a mighty dinner.
Two of Moses's fattest chickens and everything
Moses had in the way of other food filled their
starved stomachs. Then to sleep. The last
thing Tom heard that night was the swish of
Towser's mighty tail upon the earthen floor as
the dog lay beside his cot. The last thing of
which he was conscious was Towser's gently
licking the hand that hung down from the cot.</p>

<p>The next day they toiled with such feeble help
as Moses could give them upon their leaky boat.
They put it in fair shape and then, with a rusty
ax which was one of Unk' Mose's most precious
possessions, they fashioned a couple of
rough oars. Then they spent a day trying to
persuade Moses to seek freedom with them. It
was in vain.</p>

<p>"I'se too old, Massa Tom," said Uncle Moses.
"Dey wuz timeses when I dun thought all de
days and dun prayed all de nights dat freedum'd
cum along or dat I cud go to freedum. It's too
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
late nowadays. Unk' Mose mus' jes' sot hyar,
a-waitin'. P'raps, ef I keeps a-helpin' udder
folkses to find deir freedum, p'raps sum day,
'fore I'se troo' a-waitin', de angel ob de Lawd'll
cum a-walkin' up to my do' and he'll be a-holdin'
by de han' ob a great big udder angel 'n de
udder angel he'll dun smile at me and say:
'Unk' Moses, I'se Freedum 'n I'se cum to you.'
Den I'll say: 'Thank de good Lawd,' and I'll be
so happy I guess I'll jes' die 'n go to de great
White Throne, whar ebberybody's free."</p>

<p>Late that afternoon when they had had to
give up the hope of taking Uncle Mose with
them, they were making a bundle of the food
he had given them. It was a big bundle. He
would have slaughtered his last chicken for
them, had they permitted it. Suddenly there
came the sound of a long, shrill whistle. Uncle
Moses, tying up the bundle on his knees, forgot
"de rumatiz" and almost sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Lawd-a-massy, dat's de oberseer! He's dun
callin' de hands to de quarters." The quarters
were the slave-quarters which always clustered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
at a respectful distance in the rear of a planter's
home. "Dat ar oberseer mebbe'll cum hyar.
You folkses mus' hide."</p>

<p>The whistle had sounded dangerously near.
As they looked out of the one door that gave
light to the slave's cabin, they saw three horsemen
trotting towards it, two white men and a
negro. They were Moses's master, the dreaded
overseer, and a groom. It was impossible to run
across the small cleared space about the cabin
and seek the woods without being seen. But
where could they hide in a one-roomed hut?</p>

<p>"De chimbley, quick, de chimbley," gasped
Uncle Mose.</p>

<p>A big chimney, full of the soot of many years
of wood-fires on the broad hearth below, filled
half one side of the room. Tom and Morris
rushed to it, climbed up the rough stone sides,
found a precarious footing just above the fireplace,
and waited. Fortunately the fire upon
which the food for the journey had been cooked
had almost died down. A little smoke floated
up the wide opening. The smoke and the soot
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
tickled the boy's nostrils until it seemed to him
that he must sneeze. A sneeze might mean
death. With a mighty effort he kept still for
what seemed to him an hour. It was really
about five minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Izzard, owner of Uncle Moses and of
some hundreds of other black men, Jake Johnson,
his overseer, a renegade Yankee, with a
face that told of the cruel soul within him,
trotted up to the door, the black groom a few
yards behind them. Uncle Moses had thrust the
bundle of food far back under the bed. He
stood respectfully in his doorway, bowing to the
ground. Towser cowered beside him. Towser
had felt more than once the sting of the long
whip Jake Johnson carried. He feared and he
hated the overseer.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Massa Izzard." said Moses.
"Howdy, Mista Johnsing. Will you-uns light
down 'n cum in?"</p>

<p>"Howdy, Uncle Moses?" Mr. Izzard replied.
He was a tall, pale, well-born, well-bred, well-educated
man, as kind a man as ever held his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
fellowmen in slavery, and as sure that he was
justified in doing so by the laws of both God
and man as the German emperor was that he
ruled a subject people by divine right. "No,
we won't light down. We just came to say
howdy. Are you getting on all right? If you
want anything, come up to the big house and
ask for it."</p>

<p>He smiled and the overseer scowled upon the
old negro as he stammered a few words of
thanks. Suddenly the overseer asked:</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Mr. Pinckney's
Morris, Mose?"</p>

<p>"No, sah, Mista Johnsing, sah, I ain't seen
hide nor har ob Morris. Has dat fool nigger
runned away?"</p>

<p>Johnson looked at him sharply.</p>

<p>"If I thought you knew already he had run
away," said he, "I'd"&mdash;he cracked his whip in
the air to show what he would have done.</p>

<p>Moses and Towser cowered. But Mr. Izzard
told Johnson to stop frightening "the best
darkey on the place" and they rode away.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Mose dropped upon his one chair and was just
about to give fervent thanks for the escape from
detection, when Johnson, who had turned a
short distance away and had galloped back,
flung himself off his horse at the door and strode
into the dusky hut.</p>

<p>"I b'lieve you know something about that
Morris," he roared at the shrinking old negro.
"You looked guilty. Tell me what you know
or I'll thrash you within an inch of your black
life." He cracked his dreaded whip again.</p>

<p>"I dun know nothin' 'bout him, Mista Johnsing,"
Moses pleaded.</p>

<p>Alas, at that moment, smoke and soot proved
too much for the overtried nostrils of Tom. He
sneezed with the vigor of a sneeze long held
back. His "at-choo! at-choo!" sounded down
the chimney like a chorus of bassoons. Johnson
was across the room in a bound. He knelt
upon the hearth, groped up the chimney, caught
the boy by the ankle and pulled him down. The
soot had made a negro of Tom. The overseer
was sure he had caught the fleeing Morris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb2">At that terrible moment, when Johnson's
throat was swelling for a yell of triumph that
would surely have brought Mr. Izzard back to
the hut, Uncle Moses cast the traditions of a life
of servile fear of the white man behind him.
Never had he dreamed of laying a finger on one
of his owner's race, even in those long-ago days
when stout thews and muscles made him fit to
fight. Now, in trembling old age, the truth of
the poet's saying,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who would be free, himself must strike the blow,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="p2">put spirit for a second into his old heart. He
knew the danger that lay in that yell. He meant
to stop it, cost him what it might. Johnson was
still on his knees in the ashes, still clutching
Tom's ankle, the boy still sprawling on the
hearth, half-dazed with the shock of discovery
and of his fall, when Uncle Moses's withered old
body hurled itself upon the overseer's broad
back and his feeble fingers clutched the man's
windpipe and choked him into a second's silence.
That second was enough. Tom sprang to his
feet and sprang at his foe like a wildcat, and good
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
old Towser, rejoicing in the vengeance that
beckoned to him, sunk his teeth in Johnson's
shoulder and tore him down from the back
while Tom struck his strongest just below the
overseer's chin and knocked him out for the time
being. Before he came to, he had been lashed
hand-and-foot into a long bundle, had been effectually
gagged with his own whip, had been
blindfolded and had been rolled beneath the
bed, from under which the food had been hurriedly
withdrawn. Meanwhile Morris had
neither been seen nor heard. Tom called up the
chimney to him to come down.</p>

<p>"I kain't, Massa Tom," said a stifled voice.
It had never occurred to Morris to slip down
and help in the fight he heard going on below.
His one thought had been to escape himself.
So he had climbed still higher up the chimney
and in his frantic haste he had so wedged himself
into it that it took Tom an hour to pull him
down. It was a battered, bruised, and bleeding
negro who finally appeared. That was a very
long hour. Mr. Izzard might return in search
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of his overseer at any moment. The overseer
himself must be conscious by this time. His
ears must have told him much. Tom whispered
to Morris and Moses to say nothing. His
anxious gesture toward the bed beneath which
Johnson lay frightened both negroes into scared
silence. Fortunately for them the overseer's
ears had told him nothing. Towser's teeth had
drawn so much blood&mdash;the mighty hound had
been pried off his foe with difficulty&mdash;that the
man lay in a faint until the four fugitives had
fled. For there were four fugitives now.
Neither Moses nor Towser could stay to face
the coming wrath. The rest of Moses's chickens
were killed, the rest of his vegetables gathered.
When darkness fell, the old flat-boat, laden until
she had a scant two inches of free-board above
the water, was slipping down the river again.
Uncle Moses was no longer "a-waitin' fer freedum."
He was going in search of the freedom
he had so long craved. He and his fellows had
two clear days in which to get away without
pursuit, for Johnson lay in his dark prison beneath
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the bed for fortyeight hours before he
was found. One of the ropes used to bind him
had caught upon an old nail in the wall. He
was too weak to tear it away and so could not
even roll himself to the outer air. On the second
day of his unexplained absence, Mr. Izzard
had sent all the negroes in search of him and
had offered a reward for his finding. The discovery
of his horse in a distant part of the plantation
had concentrated the search there. The
darkies who finally got the reward did not rejoice
much in it, for in finding the overseer, they
knew they were finding a cruel taskmaster and
his cruel whip. But the story of his discomfiture
by three negroes, for he had never known
that Tom's sooty face was really white, soon
spread through the countryside. He became a
neighborhood joke and in his wrath at being
made a butt he resigned as Mr. Izzard's overseer.
Leaving this place deprived him of his
immunity from conscription. He was promptly
seized by the nearest Confederate officer and
impressed into the army. The Izzard negroes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
had the infinite joy of seeing their hated ex-overseer
marched off under guard to a Confederate
camp, to serve as a private soldier.</p>

<p>Tom was destined to see Jake Johnson again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two nights they rowed down the river, almost
without a word, afraid to speak lest someone
in the infrequent houses and still more infrequent
villages along the banks should hear
them. Wise old Towser knew enough not to
bark when men about him kept so still. He lay
always where with nose or paw or tail he could
touch Tom. The latter was the commander of
the expedition and Towser felt it and became
his abject slave accordingly. At the close of the
second night they had reached the Tennessee
River. By day they camped upon shore in some
hidden place, first craftily secreting the boat
amid rushes and reeds. From their second
hiding-place, they saw about noon a Confederate
gunboat, a small stern-wheel steamboat,
with cotton-bales at her bow and stern screening
her two guns. Though she was making
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
all possible speed up the current, she moved
but slowly. Her decks were thick with excited
men. A babble of voices reached the fugitives,
peering at her behind a mass of bushes. The
few words that could be made out told them
nothing. The sight of her, however, warned
them that a new danger might await them on
the traveled waters of the Tennessee. Their
hearts would have beat higher, had they known
that General Mitchell had pushed south from
Huntsville and that Union forces were then encamped
in strength upon the river, not many
miles below where they were cowering. The
Confederate gunboat had been steaming upstream
to escape capture.</p>

<p>When darkness came, they embarked again
upon what proved to be the last chapter in the
history of the old flat-boat. The next morning,
caught in an eddy at the mouth of a small, swift
tributary of the Tennessee, she whirled about,
the Spanish moss dropped out of her rotten
seams, she filled and sank. She dropped so
swiftly beneath them that before they realized
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
their danger they were all floundering in water
over their heads. Tom could swim like a fish.
That is one of the first things a boy should learn
to do. To his delight, he found Uncle Moses
was also surprisingly at home in the water, considering
his years. Towser accepted the situation
as something he did not understand, but
which was doubtless entirely all right, as his
lord and master, Tom, was in the water too.
Morris, however, could not swim a stroke and
saw only certain death before him. He gave a
yell of terror as he went under. That yell came
near costing them dear. As he rose to the surface,
Tom on one side and Uncle Mose on the
other, acting under Tom's instructions, edged a
shoulder under him, and started to swim to
shore with him. Again he yelled. This time
Moses lost patience.</p>

<p>"Shet up, you fool nigger. You sho'ly needs
to be 'mersed."</p>

<p>With this whispered menace, he reached up
one hand and ducked Morris's head quite under
water. That stopped all further sound from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
him. And by this time their feet had touched
bottom. They waded ashore, with Towser wagging
a triumphant tail, shaking himself and
sending showers of spray over them. There
they stood, wet as water-rats, with nothing in
the world except the dripping clothes they wore.
And there was no hiding-place near. For half
a mile on either side of them a cleared field lay
open to the day and the day was upon them.
They had tempted Fate by rowing on too long
after the first signs of dawn. Fate had turned
the trump upon them. The sun rolled up above
the eastern horizon at their back. It showed
them, not half a mile away, a plantation house.
It showed them a swarm of field-hands coming
to the day's toil. It showed them a mounted
overseer, only a few hundred feet away, riding
up to the flat range of the field from a ravine
that had hidden him. He had heard Morris's
yells. He saw the three and rode furiously at
them, calling out:</p>

<p>"What are you niggers doin' here?"</p>

<p>Tom stepped forward to meet him. His two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
companions were useless in an emergency like
this. They cowered back and were dumb.
Towser strode ahead beside Tom and barked.
The overseer pulled up short. He saw he was
dealing with a white man, or rather with a white
boy. The circumstances were suspicious. Who
were these three dripping ragamuffins? But
since one of them was white, the man's tone
changed and he modified his question.</p>

<p>"Who are ye? And what are ye doin' here?"</p>

<p>"I am on my way to Vicksburg," Tom answered,
"by the river. My boat sunk just off
shore here and we swam ashore. Can you give
me another boat?"</p>

<p>"I mout 'n I moutn't."</p>

<p>"I am carrying dispatches," said Tom,
sternly. "You will delay me at your peril. I
shall take one of those boats, whether you consent
or not."</p>

<p>With this he pointed at the most encouraging
thing the sunrise had shown him. This was a
line of three boats fastened to a wooden landing-place
by the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I b'lieve you're a Yankee," said the horseman,
"and these are runaway niggers. You and
they must come up to the big house with me.
If you're all right, we'll send you on your way.
If you're not, well, we know what to do with
Yanks and runaway niggers! March!"</p>

<p>He slipped his hand behind him, as if to draw
a pistol. Tom was already making the same
gesture. Neither of them had a pistol. Tom's
had gone to the bottom. It was pure bluff on
both sides. And in a moment, seeing this and
being Americans, both laughed. But none the
less the overseer demanded that they should go
to the big house. Tom, protesting, but apparently
half-yielding, edged along until he was
near the landing-platform. Then, shouting
"Come on, boys!" he ran to it, the frightened
negroes following at his heels and Towser running
ahead. He hustled them into the boat at
the eastern end of the pier, jumped in himself,
jerked the rope off the wooden peg that insecurely
held it, and pushed off. The overseer,
angrily protesting, stood a moment watching his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
prey escape and then galloped like mad for the
big house, shouting "Yanks! spies!! thieves!!!
Yanks!!!!" He was met halfway by half a
dozen men in Confederate gray, roused by his
yells. They were officers who had spent the
night at the hospitable house, had breakfasted
at daybreak, and were just about to mount for
their day's march when the overseer gave the
alarm. It was lucky for the fugitives that officers
do not carry anything bigger than pistols.
A fusillade of revolver-bullets all fell short of the
fleeing mark. Tom and Morris were pulling an
oar apiece&mdash;they had found but two in the boat&mdash;with
a desperate energy. But it was unlucky
for the fugitives that they had not thought to
steal or to scuttle the other two boats. This
was Tom's fault, for he was captain.</p>

<p>"I'll know better next time," said Tom to
himself ruefully, as he saw three men spring
into each boat for the pursuit. "I'll know better
next time&mdash;if there ever is a next time."</p>

<p>It did not seem likely that there would be a
next time. One of the pursuing boats fell behind,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to be sure. In it, too, there were but two
oars and the men who plied them could not
match the black man and the white boy who
rowed for freedom's sake and life's sake. But
in the other boat, two strong men each pulled
two oars, while the third man crouched in the
bow, pistol in hand, calling out steering instructions.
This boat gained upon them, bit by bit.
The fugitives could hear the lookout call "Port,
hard-a-port!" and could almost see the extra
weight thrown into the sweep of the starboard
oars to send the boat's head the right way.
Once the man at the bow took a chance on a
long shot. His bullet fell harmlessly two hundred
feet astern of Towser who stood in the
stern of the fleeing boat, barking savagely.
Thrice they turned a sharp bend and were out
of sight of their enemy for a moment, but each
time there was a shorter interval before the
enemy shot into sight behind them. A fourth
point lay just ahead. Tom looked back over his
shoulder and measured the distance with his
eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"We can just make that next point," he
panted. "Soon as we do, we'll land and run.
It's our only chance."</p>

<p>"I kain't run," said Uncle Moses, "but you'se
right, Massa Tom. Dey'll catch us ef we keep
a-rowin'."</p>

<p>They had almost reached the bend. Another
strong pull would have sent them around it.
But the pursuers had now so gained upon them
that the lookout chanced another shot. By
chance or by skill, it was a very good shot. The
bullet struck Tom's oar, just above the blade.
The blade dropped off as Tom was putting
every ounce of his failing strength into a prodigious
pull. The handle, released from all
pressure, flew through the air and Tom rolled
over backwards into Morris's lap. There was a
shout of triumph from astern. The rowers bent
to their work with a fierce vigor, feeling the victory
won. Morris gave one last pull with his
one oar and it sent the boat around the bend.</p>

<p class="pmb2">"And dere," as Uncle Moses with widespread
arms used to tell the tale thereafter, "and dere
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
wuz Massa Lincum's gunboats, a-crowdin' ob de
ribber&mdash;'n de Stars-'n-Stripeses, dey jest kivered

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <span class="caption font08">TOWSER</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">And so Unk' Mose and Morris came to their
freedom and Tom came to his own. Towser
became Tom's own. Uncle Moses insisted upon
this and Towser highly approved of it. The
giant hound worshiped the boy. Morris was
speedily put to work driving a four-mule team
for the commissary department of General
Mitchell's force. He was accustomed to having
food and lodging doled out to him, so it seemed
quite natural to be given sleeping quarters
(usually under the canvas cover of the wagon
he drove) and rations, but it took him some
months to recover from the shock of actually
being paid wages for his work. When this too
became natural, he felt that he was really free.
Uncle Moses was too old for that sort of thing.
He was bewildered by the rough and teeming
life of an army-camp. He clung to Tom, was as
devoted to him as Towser was, and much more
helpless than the dog was. Towser made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
friends and important friends at once. It happened
that food was rather short at headquarters
the day after the fugitives found safety.
Tom, waiting for a chance to go North, had been
asked to share the tent of a staff-officer and to
eat at headquarters' mess. An hour before dinner,
one of his hosts was bewailing the scanty
fare they were to have when Towser sidled
around the corner of the tent with a fat chicken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
in his mouth and laid it with respectful devotion
at his master's feet. There was a shout of applause
and a roar from the assembled officers of
"Good dog, good dog, Towser, do it again!"
Whereupon, after some majestic wags of his
mighty tail, he disappeared for a few minutes
and did do it again. When the second chicken
was laid at Tom's feet, Towser's position was
assured. He was named an orderly by acclamation
and was given a collar made of an old army
belt, with the magic letters "U. S. A." upon it,
a collar which he wore proudly through his
happy life.</p>

<p>Tom, who felt quite rich when his arrears of
pay were handed him, decided to give himself a
treat by making Uncle Moses happy. That is
the best kind of treat man or boy can give himself.
Make somebody else happy and you will
be happy yourself. Try it and see. So, when
he finally started back for Cairo and Washington
he took both Uncle Moses and Towser with
him. Neither of them had ever been on a railroad
train before. Equally bewildered and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
equally happy, they sped by steam across the
thousand miles between Cairo and Washington.
In those days dogs could travel with their masters,
without being banished to the baggage-car.
As the three neared the latter city, the great
dome of the Capitol sprang into sight. Tom
eagerly pointed it out.</p>

<p>"Look, Uncle Mose, look, Towser, there's
the Capitol."</p>

<p>"Dat's Freedum's home," murmured Unk'
Mose.</p>

<p>And Towser, stirred by the others' emotion,
barked joyfully. He felt at home, too, because
he was with Tom.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Tom neared the White House with a beating
heart. He had done what Lincoln had
bade him do. The dispatches had been carried
safely and had been put into General Grant's
hands. But he had taken a rather large
advantage of the President's smiling suggestion
that he might occasionally slip into a
fight if he wanted to do so. He had volunteered
to go with Andrews on the railroad
raid, which was to take a week, and he
had been away for many weeks, during which
he had been carried on the army-rolls as "missing."
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Would the President think of him as a
truant, who had run away and stayed away from
duty? John Hay's welcome of him was frigid.
The boy's heart went down into his boots. But
it sprang up into his mouth when he was
ushered into Lincoln's room, to be greeted with
the winning smile he knew so well and to be
congratulated both on his bravery in going with
Andrews and on his good fortune in finally getting
back to the Union lines.</p>

<p>The President was not alone when Tom
entered the room. There sat beside the desk a
middle-aged woman, worn and weary, her eyes
red with weeping, her rusty black dress spotted
with recent tears. Her thin hands were nervously
twisting the petition someone had prepared
for her to present to the President. She
looked at him with heartbroken pleading as he
turned to her from Tom and resumed his talk
with her which Tom's entrance had interrupted.</p>

<p>"So Secretary Stanton wouldn't do anything
for you, Mrs. Jenkins?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir; no, Mr. President," sobbed the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
woman. "He said&mdash;he said it was time to make
an example and that my boy Jim ought to be
shot and would be shot at&mdash;at&mdash;sunrise tomorrow."</p>

<p>The sentence ended in a wail and the woman
crumpled up into a heap and slid down to the
floor at the President's feet. She had gained
one moment of blessed oblivion. Jim, "the
only son of his mother and she a widow," had
overstayed his furlough, had been arrested, hurried
before a court-martial of elderly officers
who were tired of hearing the frivolous excuses
of careless boys for not coming back promptly
to the front, had been found guilty of desertion,
and had been sentenced to be shot in a week.
Six days the mother had haunted the crowded
anteroom of the stern Secretary of War, bent
beneath the burden of her woe. Admitted at
last to his presence, her plea for her boy's life
had been ruthlessly refused.</p>

<p>"The life of the nation is at stake, madam,"
Stanton had growled at her. "We must keep
the fighting ranks full. What is one boy's life
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to that of our country? It is unfortunate," the
grim Secretary's tones grew softer at the sight
of the mother's utter anguish, "it is unfortunate
that the life happens to be that of your boy, but
an example is needed and an example there shall
be. I will do nothing. He dies at sunrise.
Good-day."</p>

<p>He rang the bell upon his desk. The sobbing
mother was ushered out and the next person on
the list was ushered in. An hour afterwards
she was with Lincoln. There was no six days'
wait at the White House for the mother of a
Union soldier.</p>

<p>When she fell to the floor in a faint, Tom
sprang to help her, but the President was
quicker than he. Lincoln's great arms lifted her
like a child and laid her upon a sofa. He
touched a bell and sent word to Mrs. Lincoln
asking her to come to him. When she did so,
she took charge of Mrs. Jenkins and speedily
revived her. But it was the President, not his
wife, who completed the cure and saved the
weeping woman's reason from wreck and her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
life from long anguish. He pointed to the petition
which had fallen from her nerveless fingers
to the floor.</p>

<p>"Hand me that paper, Tom."</p>

<p>He put on his spectacles and started to read
it. The glasses grew misty with the tears in his
eyes. He wiped them with a red bandanna
handkerchief, finished reading the paper, and
wrote beneath it in bold letters: "This man is
pardoned. A. Lincoln, Prest." Then he held
the petition close to the sofa so that the first
thing Mrs. Jenkins saw as she came back to consciousness
in Mrs. Lincoln's arms was Jim Jenkins's
pardon. It was that blessed news which
made her herself again. She broke into a torrent
of thanks, which Lincoln gently waved
aside.</p>

<p>"You see, ma'am," said the President, "I
don't believe the way to keep the fighting ranks
full is to shoot one of the fighters, 'cause he's
been a bit careless. There's a Chinese proverb:
'Never drown a boy baby.' I guess that means
that if a boy makes a mistake, it's better to give
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
him a chance not to make another. You tell
Jim from me to do better after this. Tom, you
take Mrs. Jenkins over to the Secretary and
show him that little line of mine. He won't like
it very much. Usually he has his own way, but
sometimes I have mine and this happens to be
one of those times. Glad you came to see me,
Mrs. Jenkins. There's lots of things you can
do to an American boy that are better than
shooting him. Here's a little note you can read
later, ma'am. Hope it'll help you a bit.
Good-by&mdash;and God bless you."</p>

<p>Tom took the widow Jenkins, dazed with her
happiness, to the War Department, where the
formal order was entered that sent Jim Jenkins
back to the front, resolute to pay his country
for the life the President had given him. Only
when the order had been entered did the mother
remember the envelope clutched in her hand
which the President had given her. It contained
no words, unless it be true that "money talks."
It held a twenty-dollar bill. Mrs. Jenkins had
spent her last cent on her journey to Washington
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and her six days' stay there. Abraham
Lincoln's gift sent her safely back to home and
happiness. When once again she had occasion
to weep over her son, a year later, her tears
were those of a hero's mother. For Jim Jenkins
died a hero's death at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania,
on July 4, 1863, that day of "the high tide of the
Confederacy," when Robert E. Lee, the great
Confederate commander, saw the surge of his
splendid soldiers break in vain upon the rocks
of the Union line, in the heart of the North.
The bullet that killed Jim Jenkins tore through
the picture of Abraham Lincoln Jim always
wore over his heart. And Lincoln found time
in that great hour of the country's salvation to
turn aside from the myriad duties of every day
long enough to write Jim Jenkins' mother a letter
about her dead son's gift of his life to his
country, a letter of a marvelous sympathy and
of a wondrous consolation, which was buried
with the soldier's mother not long afterwards,
when she rejoined in a world of peace her soldier
son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Jenkins's experience with Stanton was a
typical one. Everybody hated to come in contact
with the surly Secretary. One day, when
Private Secretary Nicolay was away, Hay came
into the offices with a letter in his hand and a
cloud on his usually gay brow. "Nicolay wants
me to take some people to see Stanton," he said.
"I would rather make the tour of a smallpox
hospital."</p>

<p>Lincoln always shrank from studying the records
of court-martials, but he often had to do
so, that justice or injustice might be tempered
by mercy. He caught at every chance of showing
mercy. A man had been sentenced to be
shot for cowardice.</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't approve that," said the President.
"'He who fights and runs away, may live
to fight another day.' Besides, if this fellow is
a coward, it would frighten him too terribly to
shoot him."</p>

<p>The next case was that of a deserter. After
sentence, he had escaped and had reached
Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess that sentence is all right," Lincoln
commented. "We can't catch him, you see.
We'll condemn him as they used to sell hogs in
Indiana, 'as they run.'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At this time the fortunes of war were not
favoring the North. There were days of doubt,
days almost of despair. A shrill chorus of abuse
of the President sounded from many Northern
newspapers. Its keynote was struck by Horace
Greeley, the editor of the New York <i>Tribune</i>
and the foremost man in a group of great editors
such as the country has never seen since.
They were Horace Greeley of the <i>Tribune</i>,
Henry J. Raymond of the <i>New York Times</i>, and
Samuel Bowles of the Springfield (Mass.) <i>Republican</i>.
Bowles wrote: "Lincoln is a Simple Susan";
Raymond demanded that he be "superseded"
as President; and Greeley, in a letter
that was published in England and that greatly
harmed the Union cause, said Lincoln ruled
"a bleeding, bankrupt, almost dying country."</p>

<p>In Tom's boyhood, the names of the three
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
were household words and names by which to
conjure. The arrows the three shot at Lincoln
pierced his heart, but his gentle patience never
gave way. He bore with their well-meant but
unjust criticism as he bore with so much else
in those dark days, careless of hurt to himself,
if he could but serve his country and do his duty
as he saw it to do. A clear light shone upon one
great duty and this he did. On September 22,
1862, he signed his famous Emancipation Proclamation,
which with its sequence the Thirteenth
Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States ended forever slavery wherever
the Stars-and-Stripes waved. In the early days
of that great September, even a boy could feel
in the tense atmosphere of the White House
that some great event was impending. Nobody
knew upon just what the master mind was
brooding, but the whole world was to know it
soon. It was not until Lincoln had written with
his own hand in the solitude of his own room
the charter of freedom for the Southern slaves
that he called together his Cabinet, not to advise
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
him about it, but to hear from him what
he had resolved to do. The messenger who
summoned the Cabinet officials to that historic
session was none other than Uncle Moses. Tom
of course had long since told the story of his
flight for freedom, including Unk' Mose's stout-hearted
attack at the very nick of time upon the
overseer. Lincoln was touched by the tale of
the old negro's fine feat. He had Tom bring
Moses to see him and Moses emerged from that
interview the proudest darkey in the world, for
he was made a messenger and general utility
man at the White House. Part of his duty was
to keep in order the room where the Cabinet
met and to summon its members when a meeting
of it was called. Uncle Moses, pacing slowly
but majestically from the White House to the
different Departments, bearing a message from
the President to his Cabinet ministers, was a
very different person from the Unk' Mose who
had cared for Tom and Morris in the Alabama
canebrake. The scarecrow had become a man.
On these little journeys, Tad Lincoln often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
went with him, his small white hand clutching
one of Mose's big gnarled, black fingers. Although
Moses knew nothing of it at the time,
the day he bore the summons to the meeting at
which the Proclamation that freed his race was
read was the great day of his life. It is well for
any man or boy even to touch the fringe of a
great event in the world's history.</p>

<p>"I dun car'd de freedum Proc-a-mation,"
Uncle Moses used to say with ever-deepening
pride as the years rolled by. In his extreme old
age, he came to think he really had carried the
Proclamation to the Cabinet, instead of simply
summoning the Cabinet to the meeting at which
the Proclamation was first read. Memory plays
queer tricks with the old. So Unk' Mose's tale
lost nothing in the telling, year after year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next evening the Cabinet gathered at a
small party at the residence of Salmon P. Chase,
Secretary of the Treasury. John Hay was
there. He wrote that evening in his diary:
"They all seemed to feel a sort of new and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
exhilarated life; they breathed freer; the President's
Proclamation had freed them as well as
the slaves. They gleefully and merrily called
themselves Abolitionists and seemed to enjoy
the novel accusation of appropriating that horrible
name." The Proclamation made it respectable
to be an Abolitionist. Every great
reform is disreputable until it succeeds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Proclamation seemed to have freed the
President too. When a man has made a New
Year's gift of freedom to millions of men in
bondage&mdash;emancipation was to take place wherever
the Stars-and-Stripes flew on January 1,
1863&mdash;such a man must have a wonderful glow
of reflected happiness. Always gentle, he grew
gentler. Always with a keen eye for humorous
absurdity, he grew still more fond of it.</p>

<p>Tom was sent for one day and hurried to the
President's office. Lincoln was stretched out at
full length, his body in a swivel-chair, his long
legs on the sill of the open window. He was
holding a seven-foot telescope to his eyes, its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
other end resting upon his toes. He was looking
at two steamboats puffing hard up the
Potomac. What news did they bring? As the
boy knocked, the President, without turning his
head, called out: "Come in, Tommy."</p>

<p>Tom opened the door and as he did so John
Hay pushed excitedly by him, a telegram in his
hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Mr. President, what do you think Smith of
Illinois has done? He is behaving very badly."</p>

<p>"Smith," answered Lincoln, "is a miracle of
meanness, but I'm too busy to quarrel with him.
Don't tell me what he's done and probably I'll
never hear of it."</p>

<p>He knew how to disregard little men and their
little deeds.</p>

<p>That night Tom sat up late. Nicolay and
Hay had asked him to spend the evening, after
the household had gone to bed, in their office.
Crackers and cheese and a jug of milk were the
refreshments and John Hay's talk was the delight
of the little gathering. Midnight had just
struck when the door opened quietly and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
President slipped into the room. Never had
Tom seen him in such guise. The only thing he
had on was a short nightshirt and carpet-slippers.
He was smiling as he entered.</p>

<p>"Hear this, boys," he said. "It's from the
'Biglow Papers.' That fellow Lowell knows
how to put things. Just hear this. He puts
these Yankee words into Jeff Davis's mouth:</p>

<p>Lincoln strode out again, "seemingly utterly
unconscious," says Hay's diary, "that he, with
his short shirt hanging about his long legs and
setting out behind like the tail feathers of an
enormous ostrich, was infinitely funnier than
anything in the book he was laughing at."</p>

<p>"That fellow Lowell" was James Russell
Lowell, an American critic, poet, and essayist,
later our Minister to England.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day Tom had a welcome letter from his
father, saying he was on his way home and
would be in Washington almost as soon as his
letter was. The letter was written from St.
Petersburg and had upon its envelope Russian
stamps. Tom had never seen a Russian stamp
before. He showed the envelope as a curiosity
to little Tad Lincoln and at that small boy's
eager request gave it to him. Tom happened
to lunch with the Lincoln family that day. Tad
produced his new possession at the table, crying
to his mother:</p>

<p>"See what Tommy has given me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who wrote you from Russia?" asked Mrs.
Lincoln.</p>

<p>"My father," the boy answered. "He sent
me good news. He's coming home right away."</p>

<p>"Your father sent me good news, too," said
Mr. Lincoln from the head of the table.</p>

<p>"What was that?" interjected the first lady
of the land.</p>

<p>"You shall know soon, my dear." Then the
beautiful smile came to the President's firm lips
and overflowed into his deep-set eyes as he said
to Tom: "The highest honor the old Romans
could give to a fellow-citizen was to decree that
he had 'deserved well of the Republic.' That
can be said of your father now. He has deserved
well of the Republic. Before long, the
world will know what he has done. Until then,"
he turned as he spoke to his wife, "until then
we'd better not talk about it."</p>

<p>This talk was in early June of 1863. By September
the whole world, or at least all the governments
of the world, did know what Mr.
Strong had done after Lincoln sent him abroad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
The whole world saw the symbol of his work,
without in many cases knowing what the symbol
signified. That symbol was the famous visit
of the Russian fleet to New York City in September
of 1863.</p>

<p>The governing classes of both England and
France were in favor of the South during our
Civil War. The English and French Empires
were jealous of the growth of the Republic and
wished to see it torn asunder. France hoped to
establish a Mexican Empire, a vassal of France,
if the Confederacy won. England needed
Southern cotton and could not get it unless our
blockade of Southern ports was broken. The
people of both France and England had little to
say as to what their governments would do.
Many distinguished Frenchmen took our side
and the mass of Englishmen were also on our
side, but the latter were helpless in the grip of
their aristocratic rulers. They testified to their
belief, however, splendidly. In the height of
what was called "the cotton famine," when the
Lancashire mills were closed for lack of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
fleecy staple and when the Lancashire mill-operatives
were facing actual starvation, a tiny group
of great Englishmen, John Bright and Thomas
Bayley Potter among them, spoke throughout
Lancashire on behalf of the Northern cause.
There was to be a great meeting at Manchester,
in the heart of the stricken district. The cost
of hall, lights, advertising, etc., was considerable.
Someone suggested charging an admission
fee. It was objected that the unemployed
poor could not afford to pay anything. Finally
it was arranged to put baskets at the door, with
placards saying that anyone who chose could
give something towards the cost of the meeting.
When it was over, the baskets were found to
hold over four bushels of pennies and ha'pennies.
The starving poor of Lancashire had
given them, not out of their abundance, but out
of their grinding want.</p>

<p>This was the widow's mite, many times multiplied.</p>

<p>The crafty Napoleon the Third, "Napoleon
the Little," as the great French poet and novelist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Victor Hugo, called him, asked England
to have the English fleet join the French fleet
in breaking our blockade and in making Slavery
triumph. England hesitated before the proposed
crime, but finally said it was inclined to
follow the Napoleonic lead, if Russia would do
likewise. Then the French Emperor wrote
what is called a holographic letter, that is, a letter
entirely in his own handwriting, to the then
Czar of Russia, asking him to send part of his
fleet on the unholy raid that was in contemplation.</p>

<p>Russia was then a despotism, with one despot.
It was not only a European and an Asiatic
Power, but an American Power as well, for it
did not sell Alaska to the United States until
1867. Despotism does not like to see Liberty
flourish anywhere, least of all near itself. Liberty
is a contagious thing. Might not the
American example infect Alaska, spread through
Siberia, even creep to the steps of the throne
at St. Petersburg? But this time, thanks to the
work of our Minister to Russia and of our extra-official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
representative there, the Hon. Thomas
Strong, Despotism stood by Liberty. The Russian
Czar wrote the French Emperor that the
Russian fleet would not be a party to the proposed
attack upon the Northern navy, but that
on the contrary it was about to sail for New
York in order that its commander might place
it at the disposal of the President of the United
States in case any Franco-English squadron appeared
with hostile intent at our ocean-gates.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the traditional
friendship between America and Russia. It explains
why New York and Washington went
mad in those September days of 1863 in welcoming
the Russian fleet and the Russian officers.
It explains why Lincoln told Tom that
his father had "deserved well of the Republic."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was at about this time that John Hay once
asked Tom:</p>

<p>"What do you think of the Tycoon by this
time, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Tycoon" and "the Ancient" were names
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
his rather irreverent secretaries had given Lincoln.
Nevertheless they both reverenced and
loved him. Their nicknames for him were born
of affection.</p>

<p>"Why, why," Tom began. He did not quite
know how to put into fitting words all he felt
about his chief. But John Hay, who was never
much interested in the opinion on anything of
anybody but himself, went on:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what he is, Tom. He's a backwoods
Jupiter. He sits here and wields both the
machinery of government and the bolts of war.
A backwoods Jupiter!"</p>

<p>Late in June of 1863 Tom again left General
Grant's headquarters. These were then in
the outskirts of Vicksburg, Mississippi. The
long siege of that town, held by a considerable
Confederate force under General Pemberton,
was nearing its end. Tom longed to be in at
the death, but that could not be. He had been
sent with dispatches to Grant and this time
there had been no suggestion by the President
that he might fight a bit if he felt like it. So he
was now again on his way to Washington. He
was a long time getting there, nearly a year; and
this was the way of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>July 2, 1863, Gen. John H. Morgan, a brilliant
and daring Confederate cavalry commander, got
his troops across the Cumberland River at
Burkesville, in southern Kentucky, on flat-boats
and canoes lashed together. None but he and
his second in command knew whither the proposed
raid was to lead. People about their
starting-point thought Morgan was merely
reconnoitering. An old farmer from Calfkills
Creek went along uninvited, because he wished
to buy some salt at a "salt-lick" a few miles
north of Burkesville and within the Union lines.
He expected to go and come back safely with
Morgan's men. After he had been through a
few marches and more fights and saw no chance
of ever getting home, he plaintively said: "I
swar ef I wouldn't give all the salt in Kaintucky
to stand once more safe and sound on the banks
of Calfkills Creek."</p>

<p>Tom Strong, second-lieutenant, U. S. A., had
not reckoned upon John H. Morgan, general
C. S. A., when he planned his journey eastward
from Cairo. No one dreamed that Morgan
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
would dare do what he did do. The Confederate
cavalry rode northward across Kentucky,
with one or two skirmishes per day to keep it
busy. It crossed the Ohio and fought for the
South on Northern soil. It threatened Cincinnati.
It threw southern Indiana and Ohio into
a frenzy of fear. It did great damage, but
damage such as the laws of civilized warfare
permit. Morgan's gallant men were Americans.
No woman or child was harmed; no man not
under arms was killed. Military stores were
seized or destroyed, food and supplies were
taken, bridges were burned, railroads were torn
up, and a clean sweep was made of all the
horses to be found. The Confederate cavalry
was in sad need of new horses. The Union officer
who led the pursuit of Morgan said, in his
official report: "His system of horse-stealing
was perfect." But so far as war can be a Christian
thing Morgan made it so.</p>

<p>Now the railroad which suffered most from
the Confederate raid was the one upon which
Tom was traveling eastward. The train he had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
taken came to a sudden stop at a way-station in
Ohio, where a red flag was furiously waved.</p>

<p>"Morgan's torn up the track just ahead,"
shouted the man who held the flag.</p>

<p>Nothing more could be learned there and
then. Of course the raiders had cut the wires.
By and by fugitives began to straggle in from
the eastward, farmers who had fled from their
farms driving their horses before them, villagers
who feared the sack and ruin that really
came to no one, women and children on foot,
on horseback, in carts, in wagons, in buggies.
Every fugitive had a new tale of terror to tell,
but nobody really knew anything. Tom questioned
each newcomer. Piecing together what
they said, he concluded that Morgan had swept
northward; that the track had been destroyed
for but a mile or so, possibly less: and that the
quickest way for him to get to Washington was
to walk across the short gap and get a train or
an engine on the other side. He could find no
one who would go with him, even as a guide,
but well-meant directions were showered upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
him. So were well-meant warnings, about ten
warnings to one direction. The railroad, however,
was his best guide-post. He started eastward,
riding a horse he had bought from one of
the fugitives. The big bay brute stood over sixteen
hands high, but the price Tom paid for him
was a good deal higher than the horse.</p>

<p>All went well at first. He soon reached the
place where the Confederates had wrecked the
railroad. Their work had been thorough. Every
little bridge or trestle had been burned. Rails
and ties had been torn up, the ties massed together
and set on fire, the rails thrown upon the
burning ties and twisted by the heat into sinuous
snakes of iron. Occasionally a hot rail had
been twisted about a tree until it became a mere
set of loops, never to serve again the purpose
for which it had been made. The telegraph
poles had been chopped down and the wires
were tangled into a broken and useless web.
In some places the rails had entirely disappeared.
Doubtless these had been thrown into
the little streams which the burned bridges had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
spanned. Altogether the road-bed looked as if
some highly intelligent hurricane and earthquake
had co-operated in its destruction. It
would be many a day before a train could again
run upon it. Morgan's system of wrecking a
railroad was almost as perfect as his system of
horse-stealing.</p>

<p>A country-road wandered along beside where
the railroad had been, so Tom's progress was
easy. Its bridges, too, had gone up in smoke,
but the little streams were shallow and could be
forded without difficulty, for June had been
rainless and hot that year. The few houses the
boy passed were shut-up and deserted. The
fear of Morgan had swept the countryside bare
of man, woman, and child. The solitude, the
unnatural solitude of a region normally full of
human life, told on Tom's nerves. He longed to
see a human being. He had now left the gap
in the railroad well behind, but he was still in
an Eden without an Adam or an Eve. So, as
dusk came, he rejoiced to see the gleam of a
candle in a farmhouse not far ahead. He was so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
sure Morgan's whole command was by this time
far to the northward that he galloped gayly up
to the house&mdash;and, perforce, presented to the
Confederacy one of the best horses seized in the
entire raid.</p>

<p>The gleam had come from a back window.
The whole front of the house was closed, but
that is common in rustic places and Tom was
sure he would find the family in the kitchen,
with both food and news to give him. Instead
he found just outside the kitchen, as he and
the big bay turned the corner, a group of dismounted
cavalrymen in Confederate gray. A
mounted officer was beside them. Two
mounted men, one carrying a guidon, was
nearby. Tom pulled hard on his right rein, to
turn and run, and bent close to his saddle to
escape the bullets he expected. But one of the
men was already clutching the left rein. The
horse reared and plunged and kicked. The
rider, to his infinite disgust, was hurled from
the saddle and landed on his hands and knees before
the group. It was rather an abject position
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
in which to be captured. The Southerners
roared with good-humored laughter as they
picked him up. Even the officer smiled at the
boy's plight.</p>

<p>Before the men, on a table outside the
kitchen door, lay a half-dozen appetizing apple
pies, evidently of that day's baking. The
farmer's wife, before she fled, had put them
there with the hope that they might propitiate
the raiders, if they came, and so might save
the house from destruction. She did not know
that Morgan's men did not make war that way.
Those of them who had come there suspected
a trap in this open offer of the pies.</p>

<p>"They mout be pizened," one trooper suggested.</p>

<p>At that moment, when they were hesitating
between hunger and fear, Tom butted in upon
them and was seized.</p>

<p>"Let the Yankee sample the pies," shouted a
second soldier when the little scurry of the capture
was over. This met instant approval and
Tom, now upon his feet, was being pushed forward
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
to the table when the officer spoke, with
a smiling dignity that showed he was the friend
as well as the commander of his rude soldiery.</p>

<p>"I'll do the sampling," he said. "Give me a
pie."</p>

<p>He bit with strong white teeth through the
savory morsel and detected no foreign taint.
The pies vanished forthwith, half of one of
them down Tom's hungry throat. Then the
officer spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Son," he said, "I suppose you borrowed that
uniform somewhere, didn't you? You're too
young to wear it by right. Who are you?"</p>

<p class="pmb2">He was a man of medium height, spare but
splendidly built, with his face bronzed by long
campaigning in the open air, regular features,
piercing black eyes that twinkled, but could
shoot fire, waving black hair above a beautiful
brow, dazzling white teeth&mdash;altogether a vivid
man. His mustache and imperial were black.
He was as handsome as Abraham Lincoln was
plain, yet there was between the two, the one
the son of a Southern aristocrat, the other the
son of a Southern poor white, an elusive resemblance.
It may have been the innate nobleness
and kindliness of both men. It may have
been the Kentucky blood which was their common
portion. At any rate, the resemblance was
there.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom took one glance at the chief of his captors
and then saluted with real respect as he
replied:</p>

<p>"I am Thomas Strong, sir, second-lieutenant,
U. S. A."</p>

<p>"Upon my word, sir, I am sorry to hear it.
We don't make war on boys. If you had been,
as I thought, just masquerading as a soldier, I
would have turned you loose at once. Now I
must take you with us."</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterwards, the little group with
Tom, disarmed but unbound, in the middle of
it, was galloping northeastward. A few yards
ahead of it the officer rode with a free bridle
rein, chatting with an aide beside him. He rode
like a centaur. Tom thought him one of the
finest soldiers he had ever seen. And so he was.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
He was Gen. Basil W. Duke, brother-in-law,
second in command, and historian of General
Morgan. He was a soldier and a gentleman,
if ever God made one.</p>

<p>A fortnight later, a fortnight of almost constant
fighting, much of it with home-guards and
militia who feared Morgan too much to fight
him hard, but part of it with seasoned soldiers
who fought as good Americans should, Morgan
crossed the Ohio again into the comparative
safety of West Virginia. He took across with
him his few prisoners, including Tom. Then,
finding that the mass of his brigade had been
cut off from crossing, the Confederate general
detached a dozen men to take the prisoners
south while he himself with most of the troopers
with him recrossed to where danger beckoned.
On July 26, 1862, at Salineville, Ohio, not far
from Pittsburg, trapped, surrounded, and outnumbered,
he surrendered with the 364 men
who were all that were left of his gallant band.
Our government made the mistake of treating
him and his officers not as captured soldiers but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
as arrested bandits. They were sent to the Ohio
State Penitentiary, whence Morgan made a daring
escape not long afterwards. He made his
way to freedom on Southern soil. Meanwhile,
Tom had been taken to captivity on that same
soil. He was in Libby Prison, at the Confederate
Capital, Richmond, Virginia.</p>

<p>His journey thither had been long and hard
and uneventful, except for the gradual loss of
the few things he had with him. His pistol
and his money had been taken when he was
first captured. Now, as he was turned over to
one Confederate command after another, bit by
bit his belongings disappeared. His boots went
early in the journey. His cap was plucked from
his head. His uniform was eagerly seized by
a Confederate spy, who meant to use it in getting
inside the Union lines. When he was finally
turned over to the Provost Marshal of the chief
Confederate army, commanded by Gen. Robert
E. Lee, he was bareheaded and barefoot and
had nothing to wear except an old Confederate
gray shirt and the ragged remains of what had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
once been a pair of Confederate gray trousers,
held about his waist by a string. He was
hungry and tired and unbelievably dirty. The
one good meal he had had on his long march
had been given him at Frederick, Maryland, by
a delightful old lady whom Tom always believed
to be Barbara Frietchie.</p>

<p>It was August now. On July 4, Grant had
taken Vicksburg and Meade had defeated Lee
at Gettysburg. The doom of the Confederacy
had begun to dawn. None the less Robert E.
Lee's tattered legions, forced back from the
great offensive in Pennsylvania to the stubborn
defense of Richmond, trusted, worshiped, and
loved their great general.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meade, the Union commander, by excess of
caution, had let Lee escape after Gettysburg.
He did not attack the retreating foe. Lincoln
was deeply grieved.</p>

<p>"We had them within our grasp," he said,
throwing out his long arms. "We had only to
stretch forth our hands and they were ours.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
And nothing I could say or do could make our
army move."</p>

<p>Four days afterwards, General Wadsworth of
New York, a gallant fighter, one of the corps
commanders who had tried to spur the too-prudent
Meade into attacking, came to the
White House.</p>

<p>"Why did Lee escape?" Lincoln eagerly
asked him.</p>

<p>"Because nobody stopped him."</p>

<p>And that was the truth of it. If Lee had been
stopped, the war would have ended nearly two
years before it did end. It is a wonderful proof
of Lincoln's wonderful sense of justice that
though he repeated: "Our army held the war
in the hollow of their hand and they would not
close it," he added at once: "Still, I am very,
very grateful to Meade for the great service he
did at Gettysburg."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lee was a son of "Light-Horse Harry" Lee,
the daring cavalry commander of the Revolution
and the author of the immortal phrase about
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Washington: "First in war, first in peace, and
first in the hearts of his countrymen." Robert
E. Lee had had an honorable career at West
Point and in the war with Mexico and was Lieutenant-Colonel
of Engineers in the United
States army when the war between the States
began. He loved his country and her flag, but
he had been bred in the belief that his loyalty
was due first to Virginia rather than to the
Union. When the Old Dominion, after first
refusing to secede, finally did so, Lieut.-Col. Lee,
U. S. A., became General Lee, C. S. A. Great
efforts were made to keep him on the Union
side. It is said he was offered the chief command
of our army. Sadly he did his duty as he
saw it. He put aside the offers made him, resigned
his commission, and left Arlington for
Richmond.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Arlington, now a vast cemetery of Union soldiers,
crowns a hill on the Virginia side of the
Potomac. The city of Washington lies at its
feet. The valley of the Potomac spreads before
it. From the portico of the old-fashioned house,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a portico upheld by many columns, one can look
towards Mt. Vernon, not many miles away, but
hid from sight by clustering hills. The house
was built in 1802 by George Washington Parke
Custis, son of Washington's stepson, who was
his aide at Yorktown in 1783, and grandson of
Martha Washington. Parke Custis, who died in
1858, directed in his will that his slaves should
be freed in five years. Lee, his son-in-law and
executor, scrupulously freed them in 1863 and
gave them passes through the Confederate lines.
He had already given freedom to his own slaves.
Long before the war, he wrote from Fort
Brown, Texas, to his wife: "In this enlightened
age there are few, I believe, but will
acknowledge that slavery as an institution, is a
moral and political evil in any country....
I think it is a greater evil to the white than the
black race."</p>

<p class="p2">Robert E. Lee was one of the greatest four
Virginians. He ranks with George Washington,
George Mason, and Thomas Jefferson. No
praise could be greater. When "the Lost
Cause," as the Southerners fondly call their
great fight for what they believed to be right,
reeled down to decisive defeat, the general
whom they had worshiped in war proved himself
a great patriot in peace. His last years were
passed as President of Washington and Lee
University in Virginia. Long before his death,
his name was honored by every fair-minded
man on the Northern as well as the Southern
side of Mason and Dixon's line. One of the
noblest eulogies of him was voiced upon the
centennial of his birth, January 9, 1907, at Washington
and Lee University, by Charles Francis
Adams. The best blood of Massachusetts honored
the best blood of Virginia. Our country
was then again one country and all of it was
free.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tom Strong was standing with a group of
other prisoners, all Northern officers, under
guard, beside the Provost Marshal's tent at
Lee's headquarters. These were upon a little
knoll, from which the eye ranged over the long
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
lines of rotten tents, huts, and heaps of brush
that gave such shelter as they could to the
ragged, hungry, and undaunted legions of the
Confederacy. It was early in the morning.
Scanty breakfasts were cooking over a thousand
fires. From the cook-tent at headquarters,
there came an odor of bubbling coffee that made
the prisoners' hunger the harder to bear. The
whole camp was strangely silent.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Then, in the distance, there was a storm of
cheering. It gained in sound and shrillness.
The soldiers poured out of their tents by the
thousand. Those who had hats waved them;
those who had not waved their arms; and every
throat joined in the famous "rebel yell."
Through the shouting thousands rode a half-dozen
superbly mounted horsemen, at their
head a gallant figure, with close-cropped white
beard, whiskers, and mustache, seated upon a
superb iron-gray horse, sixteen hands high, the
famous Traveler.</p>

<p class="p2">It was Robert E. Lee, the one hope of the
Confederacy. Even his iron self-control almost
broke, as he saw the passionate joy with which
he was hailed by the survivors of the gallant
gray army he had launched in vain against the
bayonet-crowned hills of Gettysburg. A flush
almost as red as that of youth crept across his
pale cheeks and a mist crept into his eyes. His
charger bore him proudly up the grassy knoll
where the Union prisoners were huddled together.
As his glance swept over them, he
noted with surprise the youthfulness of the boy
who stood in the front line. Many a boy as
young as Tom or even younger was in the ranks
Lee led. Many an old man bent under the
weight of his gun in those ranks. The Confederacy,
by this time almost bled white, was said
to have "robbed the cradle and the grave" to
keep its armies at fighting strength. The North,
with many more millions of people, had not been
driven to do this. Tom was one of the few
boys in the armies of the Union.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" asked Lee, as he checked
Traveler before the group.</p>

<p>"Thomas Strong, sir," answered the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your rank?"</p>

<p>"Second-lieutenant, sir."</p>

<p>"Where were you captured?"</p>

<p>"In Ohio, sir, by General Morgan."</p>

<p>Tom was faint with hunger as he was put
through this little catechism. As he made the
last answer, he reeled against the next prisoner,
Col. Thomas E. Rose, of Indiana, who caught
and held him. Lee misunderstood the movement.
His lip curled with disgust as he said:</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;a boy&mdash;drunk?"</p>

<p>Tom was too far gone to answer, but Rose
and a half-dozen others answered for him.</p>

<p>"Not drunk, but hungry, General."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," the courteous Virginian
replied, "but at least you shall be hungry no
longer. My staff and I will postpone our breakfast
until you have eaten. Pompey!" An old
negro came out of the cook-tent. He had been
one of George Washington Parke Custis's
slaves. When freed, he had refused to leave
"Marse Robert," whose cook he had become.
He wore the remains of a Confederate uniform.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
"Pompey, give these gentlemen our breakfast.
We will wait."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;Marse Robert, I'se dun got real
coffee dis mornin'."</p>

<p>"Our involuntary guests," said Lee with a
gentle smile as he turned to the prisoners, "will,
I hope, enjoy the real coffee."</p>

<p>And enjoy it they did. It and the cornbread
and bacon that came with it were nectar and
ambrosia to the hungry prisoners. The only
fleck upon the feast was when one of them, in
his hurry to be served, spoke rudely to old
Pompey. The negro turned away without a
word, but his feelings were deeply hurt. When
the Union officer hurled after him a word of
foul abuse, Pompey turned back, laid his hand
upon his ragged uniform, and said:</p>

<p>"I doesn't objeck to de pussonal cussin', sah,
but you must 'speck de unicorn."</p>

<p>After that the "unicorn" and the fine old
negro who wore it were both amply respected.
When everything in sight had been eaten, the
prisoners were ordered to fall in line. Their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
guards stood in front of the little column, beside
it, behind it.</p>

<p>"Forward, march!"</p>

<p>They marched southward for a few miles,
tramped through the swarming, somber streets
of Richmond, and reached Libby Prison. Its
doors closed behind them with a clang. Captivity
in the open had been hard enough to bear.
This new kind of captivity, within doors, with
barred windows, was to be harder yet. Tom
was to spend six weary months in Libby Prison.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was while he was there that Abraham Lincoln
made his wonderful Gettysburg speech.</p>

<p>The battlefield of Gettysburg was made
sacred by the men who died there for Freedom's
sake and also by the men who died there
for the sake of what they honestly thought were
the rights of the Slave States. Congress made
the battlefield a Soldiers' Cemetery. It was to
be dedicated to its great memories on November
19, 1863. The morning before a special train
left Washington for Gettysburg. It carried
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
President Lincoln, Secretary of State Seward,
two other members of the Cabinet, the two private
secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, the distinguished
Pennsylvanian, Wayne MacVeagh,
later U. S. Attorney-General and later still our
Minister to Italy, and others of lesser note.
Among those latter was the Hon. Thomas
Strong, who had been made one of the party by
Lincoln's kind thoughtfulness. It was he who
afterwards told his son the story of Lincoln's
Gettysburg speech, scarcely regarded at the moment,
but long since recognized as one of the
masterpieces of English literature.</p>

<p>The little town of Gettysburg was in a ferment
that November night, when the President's
train arrived. It was full of people and
bands and whisky. Crowds strolled through
the streets, serenading statesmen and calling for
speeches with an American crowd's insatiable
appetite for talky-talk. "MacVeagh," says
Hay, "made a most beautiful and touching
speech of five minutes," but another Pennsylvanian
made a most disgusting and drunken
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
speech of many minutes. Lincoln and most of
his party of course had no share in all this brawling
merriment. He and Seward had talked
briefly to shouting thousands early in the
evening.</p>

<p>On the way up from Washington, the President
had sat in a sad abstraction. He took little
part in the talk that buzzed about him. Once,
when MacVeagh was vehemently declaiming
about the way the Southern magnates were misleading
the Southern masses, Lincoln said with
a weary smile one of those sayings of his which
will never be forgotten. "You can fool part of
the people all the time; you can fool all the
people part of the time; but you can't fool all
the people all the time." Then he became silent
again. He did not know what he was to say
on the morrow. The chief oration was to be
by Edward Everett of Massachusetts, a trained
orator, fluent and finished in polished phrase.
He had been Governor of Massachusetts, Minister
to England, Secretary of State, United
States Senator. He was handsome, distinguished,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
graceful. The ungainly President felt
that he and his words would be but a foil to
Everett and his sonorous sentences, sentences
that were sure to come rolling in like "the
surge and thunder of the Odyssey." Everett had
graduated from Harvard, Lincoln from a log-cabin.
Both must face on the morrow the same
audience.</p>

<p>The President searched his pockets and found
the stub of a pencil. From the aisle of the car,
he picked up a piece of brown wrapping paper,
thrown there by Seward, who had just opened
a package of books in the opposite seat. He
penciled a few words, bent his head upon his
great knotted hand in thought, then penciled a
few more. Then he struck out some words and
added others, read his completed task and did
not find it good. He shook his head, stuffed the
brown wrapping paper into his pocket, and took
up again his interrupted talk with MacVeagh.</p>

<p>At eleven the next morning, from an open-air
platform on the battlefield, Everett held the vast
audience through two hours of fervent speech,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
fervent with patriotism, fervent also with bitterness
against the men he called "the Southern
rebels." His speech was literature and his
voice was music. As the thunder of his peroration
ended a thunderstorm of applause began.
When it, too, died away, there shambled to the
front of the platform an ungainly, badly dressed
man, contrasting sharply and in every way disadvantageously
with Everett of the silver
tongue. This man's tongue betrayed him too.
He tried to pitch his voice to reach all that vast
audience and his first words came in a squeaking
falsetto. A titter ran through the crowd. Lincoln
stopped speaking. There were a few seconds
of painful silence. Then he came to his
own. With a voice enriched by a passionate
sincerity, he began again and finished his Gettysburg
speech. Here it is:</p>

<p>"Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers
brought forth on this Continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal. Now we
are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so
dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a
great battlefield of that war. We have come to
dedicate a portion of it as a final resting-place
for those who here gave their lives that that
nation might live. It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this. But in a larger
sense we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow, this ground. The brave men,
living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated
it far above our poor power to add or
to detract. The world will little note nor long
remember what we say here, but it can never
forget what they did here. It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
work which they who fought here have
thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
to be here dedicated to the great task remaining
before us&mdash;that from these honored dead we
take increased devotion to that cause for which
they here gave the last full measure of devotion&mdash;that
we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain; that this nation,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
under God, shall have a new birth of freedom;
and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people shall not perish from the
earth."</p>

<p>The President ceased to speak. There was no
thunderstorm of applause such as had followed
Everett's studied sentences and polished periods.
There was no applause at all. One long stir of
emotion throbbed through the silent throng, but
did not break the silence. Then the multitude
dispersed, talking of what Everett had said,
thinking of what Lincoln had said. Most of the
notables on the platform thought the President's
speech a failure. Time has shown that it was
one of the greatest things even he ever did.</p>

<p>Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews has written
in her short story "The Perfect Tribute"
the history of the Gettysburg speech. The boy
who would know what manner of man our
Abraham Lincoln was should read "The Perfect
Tribute." One of the characters in the
story, a dying Confederate officer, says to Lincoln
without knowing to whom he was speaking:
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
"The speech so went home to the hearts
of all those thousands of people that when it
ended it was as if the whole audience held its
breath&mdash;there was not a hand lifted to applaud.
One might as well applaud the Lord's prayer&mdash;it
would be sacrilege. And they all felt it&mdash;down
to the lowest. There was a long minute
of reverent silence, no sound from all that great
throng&mdash;it seems to me, an enemy, that it was
the most perfect tribute that has ever been paid
by any people to any orator."</p>

<p>The Gettysburg speech was not for the moment.
It is for all time.</p>

<p class="pmb2">When the war between the States began,
Libby &amp; Son were a thriving firm of merchants
in Richmond. They owned a big warehouse,
which fronted on Carey Street and extended
back over land that sloped down to
another street, which occupied all the space between
the southern wall of the warehouse and
the canal that here bordered the James River.
The building was full before the war of that
rich Virginia tobacco which Thackeray praises in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
"The Virginians" and which the worn-out lands
of the Old Dominion can no longer produce.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/illo_235.jpg" width="600" height="468" alt="LIBBY PRISON AFTER THE WAR" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08 smcap">LIBBY PRISON AFTER THE WAR</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">The prisoners in Libby had painfully little to
eat. The whole South was hungry. When Confederate
soldiers were starving, Confederate
prisoners could not expect to fatten. Nor was
this the only evil thing. The prison was indescribably
unclean. The cellar and the lower
floor, upon which no prisoners were allowed
except in the dining-room in the middle of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
floor and the hospital, swarmed with huge rats
which climbed upstairs at night and nipped
mouthfuls of human flesh when they could.
There was no furniture. The prisoners slept on
the floor, so crowded together that they had to
lie spoon fashion in order to lie down at all.
They had divided themselves into squads and
had chosen commanders. Tom found himself
assigned to Squad Number Four. The first
night, when he had at last sunk into uncomfortable
sleep upon the hard floor, he was awakened
by the sharp command of the captain of
his group:</p>

<p>"Attention, Squad No. Four! Prepare to
spoon! One, two, spoon!"</p>

<p>The squad flopped over, from one weary
bruised side to another. It seemed to the worn-out
boy that he had just "spooned," when again
he waked to hear the queer command and again
he flopped. This was a sample of many nights.</p>

<p>On the following morning Tom had one of the
narrow escapes of his life. He was leaning
against one of the barred windows, looking at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the broad valley of the James, when he was suddenly
seized violently by the arm and jerked to
one side. His arm ached with the vice-like grip
that had been laid upon it and his knees, sticking
through his torn trousers, had been barked
against the floor, as he was dragged back, but
he turned to the man who had laid hold of him,
not with anger, but with thankfulness. For, at
the second he had been seized a bullet had
whizzed through the window just where his
head had been. If he had not been jerked away,
the Chronicles of Tom Strong would have ended
then and there.</p>

<p>If Tom was not angry, the man was. He
glared at him.</p>

<p>"You little fool, don't you know better than
that?"</p>

<p>When the boy heard himself called a fool, he
did become angry, but after all this big person
had saved his life, even if he did call him names.
So he swallowed his wrath&mdash;which is an excellent
thing to do with wrath&mdash;and answered
quite meekly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, sir, I don't know better. Can't we look
out of the windows?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't anybody told you that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I shouldn't have called you a fool."
Tom smiled and nodded in acceptance of the
implied apology. "The sentries outside have
orders to fire whenever they see anybody at a
window. Last week two men were killed that
way. I thought you were a goner, sure, when
I saw you looking out. Sorry if I hurt you, but
it's better to be hurt than to be killed. Shake."</p>

<p>The boy wrung the big man's hand and
thanked him for his timely aid. They strolled
together up and down the big room now deserted
by most of its occupants, who had begun
below their patient wait for dinner. The man
was Colonel Rose. He found Tom to his liking.
And he needed an intelligent boy in his business.
Just then Colonel Rose's business was to
escape. This seemed hopeless, but the Colonel
did not think so. Yet it had been often tried
and had always failed. When several hundred
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
intelligent Americans are shut up, through no
fault of their own, in a most unpleasant prison,
with nothing to do, they are quite certain to
find something to do by planning an escape and
by trying to make the plan a reality. One trouble
about the former plans at Libby had been
that the whole mass of prisoners had known
about them. There must always be leaders in
such an enterprise, but hitherto the leaders had
taken the crowd into their confidence. Now
there were Confederate spies in the crowd, sham
prisoners. The former plots had always been
found out. Once or twice they had been allowed
to ripen and the first fugitives had found their
first free breath their last, for they had stumbled
into a trap and had been instantly shot
down upon the threshold of freedom. More
often the ringleaders had disappeared, spirited
away without warning and probably shot, while
their scared followers had been left to despair.
Rose had learned the history of all the past attempts.
He planned along new lines. He decided
upon absolute secrecy, except for the men
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
who were actually to do the work. This work
involved a good deal of burrowing into holes
that must be particularly narrow at first and
never very big. A strong, lithe boy could get
into a hole where a stout man could not go.
Once in, he could enlarge it so that many men
could follow. Colonel Rose wanted a human
mole. He had picked Tom Strong for the job.
Now, in whispered sentences, he told the boy
of the plan and asked his aid. Tom's shining
eyes threatened to tell how important the talk
was.</p>

<p>"Act as though you were uninterested, my
boy," Colonel Rose warned him. "Keep your
eyelids down. Yawn occasionally."</p>

<p>So Tom tried to look dull, which was not at
all his natural appearance. He studied the
floor as if he expected to find diamonds upon it.
He yawned so prodigiously as to attract the
attention he was trying to escape. An amateur
actor is apt to overact his part. And all the
time he was listening with a passionate interest
to Colonel Rose's story of the way to freedom.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Of course he was glad to try to help make the
hope a fact.</p>

<p class="pmb1">That night the work began. The kitchen
dining-hall was deserted from 10 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> to 4 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
so it was selected as the field of operation. Below
the kitchen was the carpenter-shop. No
opening could be made into that without instant
detection. On the same floor with the kitchen
and just east of it was the hospital. That room
must be avoided too. Below the hospital was
an unused cellar, half full of rotting straw and
all full of squealing rats. It was called "Rat
Hell." Outside of it was a small sewer that
led to a larger one which passed under the canal
and emptied its contents into the James River.
These sewers were to be the highway to freedom.
The first step must be to get from the
kitchen to Rat Hell. To do this it was necessary
to dig through a solid stone wall a reversed
"S," like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60px;">
  <img src="images/illo_241.jpg" width="60" height="48" alt="Reverse S" title="" />
</div>

<p class="p1">The upper end of the secret passage was to
open into the kitchen fireplace, the lower into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Rat Hell. There were fourteen men in the
secret, besides Tom. Between them, they had
just one tool, an old knife. One of them owned
a bit of burlap, used sometimes as a mattress
and sometimes as a bed-quilt. It had a new
use now. It was spread upon the kitchen hearth
in the midnight darkness and a pile of soot was
pulled down upon it. Then the mortar between
a dozen bricks at the back of the fireplace was
cut out with the knife and the bricks pried out
of place. This was done by Major A. G. Hamilton,
Colonel Rose's chief assistant. He carefully
replaced the bricks and flung handfuls of
soot over them. He and Rose crept upstairs,
carrying the sooty bit of burlap with them, and
slept through what was left of the night. The
next day was an anxious time for them. When
they went down to the kitchen, where a couple
of hundred men were gathered, it seemed to
them that the marks of their toil by night were
too plain not to be seen by some of them. Their
nervousness made them poor judges. Nobody
saw what had been done. That night, as soon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
as the last straggler left, Rose and Hamilton
again removed the bricks and attacked the stubborn
stone behind the fireplace. Fortunately
the stones were not large. Bit by bit they were
pried out of the loosened mortar.</p>

<p>Now came Tom's chance to serve the good
cause. He was a proud boy, a few nights later,
when he was permitted to go down to the
kitchen with the Colonel and the Major, in order
that he might creep into the hole they had made
and enlarge it. His heels wiggled in the air.
He laid upon his stomach in the upper part of
the reversed "S" and plied the old knife as
vigorously as it could be plied without making
a tell-tale noise. When he had widened the passage,
one of the men took his place in it and
drove it downward. One night Colonel Rose
in his eagerness got into the opening before
the lower part of it had been sufficiently
enlarged and stuck there. It was only by
a terrible effort that Hamilton and Tom finally
dragged him out, bruised, bleeding and gasping
for breath. Finally, after many nights,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Rat Hell was reached. A bit of rope, stolen
from about a box of food sent a prisoner,
had been made into a rope ladder. It was hung
from the edge of the hole. The three crept cautiously
down to Rat Hell. This haven did
not seem much like heaven. With squeals of
wrath, the rats attacked the intruders and the
intruders fled up their ladder. They were no
match for a myriad rats. Moreover they feared
lest the noise would bring into the basement the
sentry whose steps they could hear on the sidewalk
outside. So they fled, taking their rope-ladder
with them, and again, as ever, they replaced
the bricks and painted them with the
friendly soot.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The next night, armed this time with sticks
of wood, they fought it out with the rats and
made them understand their masters had come
to stay. Fortunately the fight was short. It
was noisy and the sentry came. But when he
opened the door from the street and looked into
the darkness of the basement, the Union officers
were safely hid under the straw and only a few
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of the defeated rats still squealed. At last the
tunnel to the sewer could be begun. Colonel
Rose had long since decided, by forbidden,
stealthy glances from an upper window, just
where it was to be. The measurement made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
above was now made below, the straw against
the eastern wall was rolled aside and the old
knife, or what was left of it after its battle with
brick and stone, was put to the easier task of
digging dirt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 474px;">
  <img src="images/illo_245.jpg" width="474" height="700" alt="FIGHTING THE RATS" title="" />
  <span class="caption"><span class="font08 smcap">FIGHTING THE RATS</span><br />
  <span class="font07a">From &quot;Famous Adventures of the Civil War.&quot;<br />
  The Century Co.</span>
  </span>
</div>

<p class="p2">Soon a new difficulty had to be met. Before
the tunnel was five feet long, the air in it became
so foul that candles went out in it. So
would the lives of the diggers have gone out if
they had stayed in it long. Five of the fifteen
now went down each night, so that everybody
had two nights' rest out of three. But the progress
made was pitifully slow. Man after man
was hauled by his heels out of the poisonous
pit, almost at his last gasp. Once, when Hamilton
had been brought out and was being
fanned back to life by Colonel Rose and Tom,
the boy whispered:</p>

<p>"Why not fan air into the tunnel?"</p>

<p>Nobody had thought of that obvious plan.
Like most great inventions it was simple&mdash;when
seen. Thereafter one or two men always sat at
the end of the tunnel fanning air into it with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
their hats. But even so, many a candle went
out and many a digger was pulled out, black in
the face and almost dead.</p>

<p>The tunnel sloped downwards, of course, to
reach the sewer. It sloped too far down. It
got below the water-level of the canal. Hamilton
was caught in it by the rush of water and
almost drowned. So much work had to be done
over again. Then came a crushing blow. When
the small sewer was finally reached, it proved
to be too small for a man to pass through it.
But it had a wooden lining, which was bit by
bit taken off. When this had been done to
within a few feet of the main sewer, two men
were detailed to cut their way through. The
next night was set as the time for the escape.
None of the thirteen slept while the two were
cutting away the final obstacle. The thirteen
did not sleep the next night either, for it was
36 hours before the two came back with their
heartbreaking news. They had found the last
few feet of the sewer-lining made of seasoned
oak, three inches thick and hard as stone. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
poor old knife that had served them so long and
so well, could not even scratch the toughened
oak. Thirty-nine nights of grinding toil had
ended in failure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the thirteen had had to face a new
problem. There were two roll-calls every day,
at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> How were the two absent
men to answer? At roll-call everybody stood in
one long line and everybody was counted. If
the count were two short, there would be swift
search for the missing. And the beginning of
the tunnel was hidden only by a few bundles of
straw. This was before they knew the tunnel
was useless, but had they known it they would
have been scarcely less anxious, for its discovery
would have made all future attempts to
escape more dangerous and more doubtful.
However, the roll-call problem was safely
solved. The thirteen crowded into the upper
end of the line and two of them, as soon as they
had answered to their own names, dropped back,
crouched down, crept behind the backs of many
men to the other end of the line, slipped into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
place, and there answered for the missing men,
without detection. In the afternoon, they came
very near being caught. Some of the other
prisoners thought this was being done just for
fun, to confuse the Confederate clerk who called
the roll, and thought they would take a hand in
the fun too. There was so much dodging and
double answering that "Little Ross," the good-humored
little clerk, lost his temper and ordered
the captives to stand in squads of ten to be
counted. By this time he had called the roll
half a dozen times, with results varying from
minus one to plus fifteen. When he gave his
order, an order obedience to which would have
certainly told the tale of two absentees, he went
on to explain why he gave it.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, there's one thing sho';
there's eight or ten of you-uns yere that ain't
yere."</p>

<p class="pmb2">This remarkable statement brought a shout
of laughter from the Confederate guards. The
prisoners joined in it. "Little Ross" himself
caught the contagion and also began to laugh.</p>

<p class="p2">The dreaded order was laughed out of court
and forgotten.</p>

<p>The two men crept upstairs early the next
morning. The first night daylight had caught
them at work, so they had not dared to return,
but had stayed and had worked through the
36 hours. They brought back the handle of
the knife, with a mere stump of a blade, and
the depressing news of failure. But men who
are fit for freedom do not cease to strive for it.
If one road to it is blocked, they seek another.
That very day, when the fifteen had gathered
together and the two had told their tale, a pallor
of despair crept over some of the faces, but
it was dispelled by the flush of hope when
Colonel Rose said: "If we can't go south, we'll
go east; we must tunnel to the yard beyond the
vacant lot. We'll begin tonight."</p>

<p>"But," objected one doubting Thomas, "from
the yard we'd have to come out on the street.
There's a gas-lamp there&mdash;and a sentry."</p>

<p>"We can put out the lamp and if need be the
sentry," Colonel Rose answered, "when we get
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
to them. The thing now is to get there. We
have fifty-three feet of tunnel to dig, if my
figures are correct. That's a job of a good many
nights. This night will see the job begun."</p>

<p>It was begun with a broad chisel kind Fate
had put in their way and with a big wooden
spittoon, tied to a rope. This, when filled with
earth, was pulled out, emptied, and returned for
a fresh load. A fortnight afterwards the officer
who was digging that night made a mistake in
levels and came too near the surface, which
broke above him. Dismayed, he backed out and
reported the blunder. The hole was in plain
sight. Discovery was certain if it were not
hidden. The story was but half told when
Colonel Rose began stripping off his blouse.</p>

<p>"Here, Tom, take this. It's as dirty as the
dirt and won't show. Stuff it into the hole so
it will lie flat on the surface. Quick!"</p>

<p>Tom wriggled along the tunnel to the hole.
There he smeared some more dirt on the dirty
blouse, put it into the hole with cunning care,
and wriggled back. That morning at sunrise,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
when they peeked down from their prison windows
into the eastern lot, even their straining
eyes could scarcely see the tiny bit of blouse that
showed. No casual glance would detect it. Of
that they were sure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every few days new prisoners were thrust
into Libby. Whenever this happened it was the
custom that on the first evening they should
tell whatever news they could of the outside
world and of their own capture to the whole
prison community. One morning the keeper
of Libby receipted for another captured Yankee
and soon Captain Jacob Johnson appeared in the
grimy upper rooms. He responded very cordially,
rather too cordially, to the greetings he
received. It soon became understood that he
was only a guerilla captain from Tennessee.
Now neither side was overproud of the guerillas
who infested the borderland, who sometimes
called themselves Unionists and sometimes Confederates,
and who did more stealing than fighting.
So a rather cold shoulder was turned to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the new captive, though the community's judgment
upon him was deferred until after he
should have been heard that evening. He
seemed to try to warm the cold shoulder by a
certain greasy sidling to and fro and by attempts
at too familiar conversation. He began to talk
to Colonel Rose, who soon shook him off, and
to sundry other persons, among whom was
Tom. The boy was not mature enough in the
ways of the world to get rid of him. Johnson
spent some hours with him and bored him to
distraction. There was a mean uneasiness about
him that repelled Tom. His face, an undeniably
Yankee face, awoke some unpleasant memory,
from time to time, but the boy could not place
him and finally decided that this was merely a
fancy, not a fact. None the less the man himself
was an unpleasant fact. He peered about
and sidled about in a way that might be due
only to Yankee curiosity, but Tom didn't like
it. He disliked Johnson more and more as the
newcomer kept returning to him and growing
more confidential. His talk was on various
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
natural enough themes, but it kept veering back
to the chances of escape.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to stay in this hole long,"
Johnson whispered. "Pretty mean-spirited in
all these fellows to just hang around here, without
even trying to make a getaway. What d'ye
say 'bout our trying it on, son?"</p>

<p>The familiar address increased the boy's dislike
of the man, but he was too young to realize
that he was being "sounded" by a spy. He
was old enough, however, to know how to keep
his mouth shut about the pending plan for an
escape. He thought Johnson got nothing out
of him, but in the many half-confidential talks
the unpleasant Yankee forced upon him, perhaps
he had revealed something after all. Perhaps,
however, the newcomer got such information
as he did from other men in the secret.
Certainly he got somewhere an inkling of the
plan of escape.</p>

<p>That evening, when he stood in a circle of sitting
men to tell his story,&mdash;a simple tale of
Northern birth, of a Southern home, of belief
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
in the Union, of raising a guerilla company to
fight for it, of capture in a raid on a Confederate
supply-depot,&mdash;the unpleasant memory
which had been troubling Tom came back and
hammered at his head until suddenly, as if a
flashlight had been turned on the scene, he saw
himself sprawling on the hearth of Uncle
Mose's slave-cabin, with this man's hand clutching
his ankle. He was sitting on the floor beside
Colonel Rose. He leant against him and whispered:</p>

<p>"That man didn't come from Tennessee. He
was overseer on a plantation in Alabama. He
'most captured me once. I b'lieve he's a spy."</p>

<p>Johnson caught the gleam of Colonel Rose's
eye fixed upon him. He had seen Tom whisper
to him. He faltered, stopped speaking, and sat
down. Rose walked across the circle and sat
beside him. He had snapped his fingers as he
walked and half a dozen men had answered the
signal and were now close at hand.</p>

<p>"What did you do before you turned
guerilla?" asked Colonel Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know that that's any of your darned
business," said Johnson.</p>

<p>"Answer me."</p>

<p>The stronger man dominated the weaker.
The spy sulkily said:</p>

<p>"I kept a general shop in Jonesboro', Tennessee."</p>

<p>"Ever live anywhere else in the South?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Ever do anything else in the South?"</p>

<p>"No, sirree. What's the good of asking such
questions?"</p>

<p>The Colonel rose to his feet and said aloud:</p>

<p>"Major Hamilton."</p>

<p>"Here, sir," answered the Major.</p>

<p>"Didn't you live in Jonesboro', Tennessee, before
the war?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"Seven years."</p>

<p>"Who kept the general store there?"</p>

<p>"Hezekiah Butterworth, from Maine."</p>

<p>"Did you know him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather. We were chums. He and I left
Jonesboro' together to join the army."</p>

<p>"Is this man he?"</p>

<p>Rose pointed to where Jake Johnson sat at his
feet, cowering, covering his face with his hands.
Other hands not too gently snatched Jake's
hands from his face. Hamilton looked at him.</p>

<p>"He's no more Hezekiah Butterworth than
he's General Grant."</p>

<p>By this time the whole prison community was
crowded about Colonel Rose. The latter called
again:</p>

<p>"Mr. Strong."</p>

<p>"Here, sir," Tom's voice piped up.</p>

<p>"Do you know this man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Tom told the story of Jake Johnson
on the Izzard plantation.</p>

<p>There was an ominous low growl from the
audience. Yankee overseers of Southern plantations
were not exactly popular in that crowd
of Northern officers. And evidently this particular
overseer had been lying. But Colonel
Rose lifted his hand and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence. No violence. What we do will be
done decently and in order." After this impressive
speech, he suddenly yelled: "Ah, you
would, would you?" and choked Johnson with
every pound of strength he could put into the
process. He had just seen him slip a bit of
paper into his mouth and he meant to know
what that paper was. It was plucked out of the
spy's throat as he gasped for air. Upon it the
spy's pencil had written:</p>

<p>"Plot to escape. Lieutenant Strong knows
about it. Think Colonel Rose heads it."</p>

<p>It was to have been Jake Johnson's first report
in his new business of being a spy. It put an
end to all business on his part forever. Gagged
and tied, he was pushed across the big room,
while Tom watched uncomprehendingly, wondering
what was to be done with the writhing
man. Suddenly he understood, for he saw it
done. Johnson was pushed into a window.
Two kneeling men held his legs and another,
standing beside him but screened by the wall,
pushed him in front of the window. The Confederate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
sentry below obeyed his orders. There
was no challenge, no warning. He aimed and
fired at the prisoner who was breaking the laws
of the prison by looking out of the window.
What had been Jake Johnson, Yankee, negro-overseer,
Confederate conscript, volunteer spy,
fell in a dead heap to the floor of Libby. Gag
and bonds were quickly removed, so there was
nothing to tell the Confederates the real cause
of the man's death when they came to remove
the body. They had unwittingly executed their
own spy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was right that the man should die, but the
shock of seeing him done to death was too much
for Tom. Weakened by the fatigues and hardship
of the long captivity during which he had
been carried from Ohio to Virginia and worn
out by the sufferings of life in Libby and by the
toil of the tunnel, the boy collapsed when Jake
Johnson did and for a few moments seemed as
dead as the man was. He was taken to the hospital-room,
but the hospital in Libby was usually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
only the anteroom of the graveyard at Libby.
One of the scarcest things in the Confederacy,
the home of scarcity, was a good doctor. The
armies in the field needed far more doctors than
there were in the whole South, at the outbreak
of the war. Medical schools were quickly
created, but the demand for doctors so far outran
the supply that by this time ignorant country
lads were being rushed through the schools,
with reckless haste, so that they were graduated
when they knew but little more than when they
began. A so-called surgeon was handling his
scalpel six months after he had been handling a
plow. Some of them barely knew how to read
and write. It was inevitable that the prison hospitals
should be manned by the poorest of the
poor among the graduates of these wretched
schools. A fortunate chance, fortunate that is
for Tom, gave him, however, care that was both
skilful and tender.</p>

<p>A few hours after the righteous execution of
Jake Johnson there had been thrust into Libby
a fresh group of prisoners, captured but fortyeight
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
hours before. Among them towered a
jovial, bearded giant, an army surgeon, Major
Hans Rolf. Libby was ringing of course with
talk of what had happened there that day. The
new prisoners quickly heard of Johnson and of
Tom Strong. Within an hour, Hans Rolf had
given his parole not to try to escape and had
been allowed to station himself beside Tom's
bed. Through that night and through the next
day, he fought Tom's battle for him, doing all
that man could do. When the boy struggled out
of his delirium and saw Rolf's kind eyes beaming
upon him, his first thought was that he was
still in the clutches of Wilkes Booth in the railroad
car. His right hand plucked feebly at his
left side, where he had then carried the dispatches
Booth sought. Hans Rolf saw and
understood the movement.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Tom," he said. "Everything's
all right. Go to sleep."</p>

<p>And Tom, still a bit stupefied, thought everything
was all right and that he was home in New
York, with Rolf somehow or other there too. A
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
gracious and beautiful Richmond woman, who
gave her days to caring for her country's
enemies, bent over him with a smile. The boy's
eyes gleamed with a mistaken belief.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh, Mother!" gasped Tom. He smiled
back and sank gently into a profound sleep, from
which he awoke to life and health. Again a
Hans Rolf had saved a Tom Strong's life.</p>

<p>Night after night passed, one night of work
by each man followed by two of such rest as
lying spoon fashion upon a hard floor allowed.
On the seventeenth night of the new tunnel
work, Colonel Rose was digging away in it. It
was over fifty feet long. His candle flickered
and went out. The foul air closed in upon him.
Hats were fanning to and fro, back in Rat
Hell, fifty feet away, but the fresh air did not
reach him. He felt himself suffocating. With
one last effort he thrust his strong fists upward
and broke through the surface. Soon revived
by the rush of fresh air into the tunnel, he
dragged himself out and found himself in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
yard that had been their aim. The tunnel had
reached its goal. He climbed out and studied
the situation. A high fence screened the yard
from Libby. A shed with an easily opened door
screened it from the street. At three <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, February
6, 1864, Colonel Rose returned to prison.</p>

<p>That morning he told his news. Most of the
men wanted to try for freedom the next night,
but there was much to do to erase all traces of
their work, so that, if the tunnel were not forthwith
discovered after their flight, it could be
used later by other fugitives. With a rare unselfishness,
they waited for sixty hours. Meanwhile
each of the fifteen had been authorized to
tell one other man, so that thirty in all could
make their escape together. Colonel Rose felt
that this was the limit. A general prison-delivery
would, he believed, result in a general recapture.
Such a secret, however, was too mighty to keep.
a whisper of it spread through the prison.</p>

<p>When Hans Rolf had saved Tom's life, he
had been at once taken into the inner councils
of the tunnel group. He had not expressed as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
much joy in the plan as Tom had expected. The
reason of this was now revealed. He declined
to go.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained to Colonel Rose and
Tom, "I gave my parole not to try to escape
when Tom here was sick. I had to do so in
order to be allowed to take care of him. I
made up my mind not to ask to be relieved from
it because if I had the Confeds. might have suspected
some plan to escape was on hand. And
they seem to have forgotten all about it, for they
haven't cancelled it. So you see I'm bound in
honor not to go. Don't bother, Tom." The
boy's face showed the agony he felt that Hans
Rolf's kindness to him should now bar Hans
Rolf's way to freedom. "Don't bother. 'Twon't
be long before I'll be exchanged. And p'raps I
can save some lives here by staying. Don't
bother. It's all right. I rather like this boarding-house."</p>

<p>The giant's great laugh rang out. The
heartiness of it amazed the weary men scattered
about the room. It brought smiles to lips that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
had not smiled for many a day. Laughter that
comes from a clean heart does good to all who
hear it.</p>

<p>It was clear that Rolf could not go. He was
an officer and a gentleman. Honor forbade it.
Sadly, Tom left him.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, February 9, 1864, when
the chosen thirty had crawled down the inverted
"S" and the rope-ladder to Rat Hell, Col.
H. C. Hobart, who knew the secret, but had gallantly
offered to stay behind, so that he could
replace the tell-tale bricks in the fireplace, replaced
them. But before he could get upstairs,
some hundreds of men had come down. The
secret was a secret no longer. There was a
fierce struggle to get to the fireplace, a struggle
all the fiercer because it had to be made in grim
silence, for there was a sentry but a few feet
away, on the other side of the wall, in the hospital.
The bricks were taken out again. In all,
one hundred and nine Union officers got through
the hole. Then, warned by approaching daylight,
the less fortunate in the fight for freedom
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
put back the bricks and crept stealthily upstairs,
resolved to try their luck the next night, if the
tunnel were not before that discovered.</p>

<p>Tom had wormed his way through the inverted
"S" among the first fifteen. On the
rope ladder he lost his hold and fell in a heap
upon the floor of Rat Hell. The huge rodents
swarmed upon him, squealing and biting. He
almost shrieked with the horror of it, but he
sprang to his feet, threw off his tormentors,
and ran across the room to the opening of the
tunnel. His ragged clothes were still more
ragged and his face and hands were bleeding
from rat-bites, but he cared nothing for all this.
Was he not on his way to freedom? On his way,
yes; but the way was a long one. He might
never reach the end. When he had pushed and
pulled himself through the tunnel; when he had
come out into the yard and gone through the
shed; and when, at the moment the sentry in
the canal street was at the further end of his
beat, he had slipped out of the doorway and
turned in the opposite direction,&mdash;when all this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
had happened, he was out of prison, to be sure,
but he was in the heart of the enemy's country,
with all the risks of recapture or of death still to
be run.</p>

<p>The men had all been cautioned to stroll away
in a leisurely fashion, on no account to run or
even to walk fast, and not to try to get away
in groups of more than two or three. It was
hard to walk slowly to the next corner. The
boy made himself do so, however. Half a block
ahead of him on the side street, he saw a couple
of men walking with a somewhat faster stride.
He hurried ahead to join them. A Confederate
patrol turned the corner of Carey Street. He
heard the two men challenged and he heard the
little scuffle as they were seized. Their brief
moment of freedom had passed. He stepped to
one side of the wooden sidewalk and crawled
under it. There was just space enough for him
to lie at full length. Hurrying feet, the feet of
men hunting other men, trampled an inch above
his nose. His heart beat so that he thought it
must be heard. The patrol reached the street
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
along the canal and peered into the darkness
there, a darkness feebly fought by one flickering
gas-lamp. Fortunately, nobody came out of the
shed just then. The sentry happened to be coming
towards it and the men inside were waiting
for him to turn. The patrol had no thought of
a general jail-delivery. It turned back with its
two prisoners, tramped back over Tom's head
to Carey Street, and took its captives to the
prison. The boy crawled out from under the
sidewalk as the next batch of fugitives, three of
them, reached the corner. He ran down to
them and warned them of the Carey Street
patrol. The three men turned with him and
walked along the canal. It was just after midnight.
Not a soul was stirring. Not a light
showed. As they walked unquestioned, their
spirits rose. How fine to be free.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Tom Hides in a River Bank&mdash;Eats Raw Fish&mdash;Jim
Grayson Aids Him&mdash;Down the James
River on a Tree&mdash;Passing the Patrol Boats&mdash;Cannonaded&mdash;The
End of the Voyage.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Tom had made up his mind how he would
try to reach the Union lines. As he had
escaped before from the locomotive-foray by
pushing boldly into the enemy's country, so
he would do now. He would try his luck in
following the James River to the sea, for off
the river's mouth he knew there lay a squadron
of Northern ships, blockading Hampton
Roads. The "Merrimac's" attempt of March,
1862, had never been repeated. Our flag was
still there, in these February days of 1864, and
Tom knew it. He had resolved to seek it there.</p>

<p>He explained his plan to his three comrades.
They would steal a boat, row or drift down the
James by night, hide and sleep by day, forage
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
for food upon the rich plantations, many of
them the historic homes of Virginia, that bordered
the broad river, and finally float to freedom
where our war-ships lay. But the three
men would have nothing to do with it. By land
the Union lines were much nearer. They meant
to stick to the land. They asked the boy to go
with them, but he stuck to his plan. So, with
hearty handshakes and a whispered "good
luck!" he left them, went over a canal-bridge,
and found himself upon the bank of the river.
He was again alone.</p>

<p>Of his three temporary companions, one
finally reached our lines, one was shot within a
few hundred yards of his goal, and one was recaptured.
Of the 109 who escaped from Libby,
48 were caught and thrust back into prison.</p>

<p>Tom walked along the river bank, prying in
the welcome darkness for a boat. It would not
have been difficult to steal it, if he could have
found it. But at this point the James is wide and
shallow and full of miniature rapids. It was
utterly bare of boats. The boy's search could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
not be carried on after dawn. He spent that
day hidden in a clump of willows by the waterside.
The excitement of the night had kept
him up. Now the reaction from it left him limp
and miserable and hungry as he never remembered
being hungry before. It was hard work
to "grin and bear it," but at least he tried to
grin and he reminded himself a thousand times
through that long, long day that he was much
better off than if he were still a prisoner in
Libby.</p>

<p class="pmb1">That night he followed the bank until he was
below the city, still without finding a boat.
There had been plenty of boats along this part
of the river the morning before, but as soon as
the escape from Libby had been discovered, all
boats had been seized by the military authorities,
to prevent their being used by the fugitives.
They had been taken to a point below the town.
As Tom wormed himself cautiously near this
point, very cautiously, for he heard voices upon
the bank above his head, and also the crackle
of a camp-fire, he saw in the gray dawn a flotilla
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of boats just below him. At first sight, his heart
leaped into his mouth with joy. At the second
sight, it sank down into his boots. For above
the boats he saw a big Confederate camp and
beyond them he saw a half-dozen small craft,
negroes at the oars and armed men at bow and
stern, patrolling the river. Hope left him. He
crawled into a hiding-place in the bank. He was
so hungry that he cried. But not for long.
Stout hearts do not yield to such weakness long.
If he could not escape in a boat fashioned by
man's hands, why not in one fashioned by God?
The early spring freshets of the James were
making the river higher every hour. He saw in
cautious peeps from the hole where he had hidden
great trees from far-off forests, uprooted
there by the high water, come plunging down
mid-channel like battering rams. He noted that
the patrol-boats gave these dangerous monsters
a wide berth. If a trunk of a tree were to ram
them or if the far-flung branches were to strike
them, their next patrol would be at the bottom
of the river. On a sandbank not a hundred
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
yards from the boy's lair a big oak had stranded.
It lay quite still now, but it evidently would not
do so for many hours, for the rising water
lapped higher and higher against it. Tom
made up his mind that that tree should be his
boat&mdash;if only it were still there when it was dark
enough for him to swim out to it. Through the
daylight hours he watched it with lynx eyes,
fearing lest it were swept along towards the sea
before he could shelter himself in it. And
through these daylight hours he grew ever more
faint with hunger, until he told himself that he
must have food, at any risk, at any cost. Without
the strength it would give, he felt he could
not possibly swim even the hundred yards that
lay between him and the now tossing tree.
There is truth in the line:</p>

<p class="center">
"Fate cannot harm me; I have dined today."<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">It is too much to do to face Fate on an empty
stomach. Napoleon said that an army traveled
on its belly. Men must have food if they are to
march and fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>A Confederate soldier sauntered along the
shore and stopped just in front of the boy's
hiding-place. He had a rude fish-pole. Either
he knew how to fish, or the James River fish
were very hungry. A string of a dozen hung
from his shoulder. The sight of them was too
much for Tom to stand. A raw fish seemed to
him the most toothsome morsel in the world.
He knew he was courting certain capture, but
he was starving. He would pretend to be a
Confederate himself. He spoke to the soldier,
not out of the fullness of his heart, but out of
the emptiness of his stomach.</p>

<p>"I'm hungry," he said, "give a fellow a fish,
will you?"</p>

<p>The soldier turned with a start. He was a
tall, gaunt man, an East Tennessee mountaineer,
who had started to join the Union army
when a Confederate conscript-officer seized him
and sent him South, under guard, to serve the
cause he had meant to fight against. East Tennessee
was, as a rule, loyal to the Union. The
men from there who were found in the Confederate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
army were like the poor peons who are
supposed to "volunteer" in the Mexican army.
"I send you fifty volunteers," wrote a Mexican
mayor to a Mexican general, "please return me
the ropes." Jim Grayson had not been tied up
with a rope, but he had had a bayonet behind
him, when he was put into the Confederate
ranks. He was a man of intelligence and of
rather more education than most of his fellow
mountaineers. Many of them could not even
read and write. Grayson had learned both at a
"deestrik skule" and had actually had a year,
a precious year, at a "high skule." The last
thing he had read before starting to fish that
morning had been the printed handbills that
had been flung broadcast by the Confederate
authorities, announcing the escape of 108 men
and one boy from Libby Prison and offering rewards
for their recapture. And the first thing
he thought as he saw Tom in his hole in the
bank was that he was probably the boy of the
handbills. He meant to give the fellow a fish,
of course, but if he found the fellow was that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
boy he also meant to do what he could to help
him go where he himself wanted to go, to the
Union lines.</p>

<p>"Sholy, I'll give you a fish," he said. "You
can have all you want. I'll light a fire and cook
some for you."</p>

<p>"I can't wait," gasped Tom, wolf-hunger in
his gleaming eyes. "I'm starving."</p>

<p>He tried to reach out for the fish and collapsed
in utter weakness. With food at last within his
grasp, he was too far gone to take it. Jim
Grayson had been very hungry more than once
in his thirty years of hard life. He saw that
Tom was telling the truth.</p>

<p>"Hush," he whispered, for he had caught
sight of some fellow soldiers on the bank, not a
hundred feet away. "Hush, sumbuddy's comin'.
You mus' take little pieces first. I'll cut one
up for you."</p>

<p>He was drawing out his knife from a deep
pocket when the soldiers stopped on the bank
above their heads and shouted down, asking him
to give them some fish too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sholy," laughed Jim. "Here's some for
you-uns."</p>

<p>He tossed half a dozen up to them and then
sat down at the mouth of the hole that sheltered
Tom, thinking to hide him in case the
others came down the bank. His back was towards
the boy. What was left of his catch hung
within two inches of Tom's nose. That was
Tom's chance. He tore off a couple of little fish
and tore them to bits with his teeth. His first
sensation was one of deathly sickness; his next
one of returning strength. Grayson twitched
the remaining fish into his lap. He knew the
boy had already had too much food, for a first
meal. Meanwhile he was chatting cheerily with
his fellow soldiers, who fortunately did not come
down the bank and soon moved off, leaving Jim
and Tom alone. Now was the time for explanations.</p>

<p>"Don't be afeard," said Jim, with a kindly
smile. "I 'low you be Tom Strong, bean't you?
I guess you was in Libby day afore yisterday.
I ain't goin' to give you up. I'm Union, I be,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
ef I do wear Secesh gray. How kin I help
you?"</p>

<p>The sense of safety, safety at least for the
moment, was too much for Tom. He could not
speak.</p>

<p>"Thar, thar," Jim went on, "it's all right.
Jes' tell me what I can do. I'll bring you eatins
soon ez night comes, but what'll you do then?"</p>

<p>Tom told him what he hoped to do then. It
was a wild scheme to float down nearly two hundred
miles of river through a hostile country,
but yet it offered a chance of success. And if
there was a chance of success for the boy, why
not for the man?</p>

<p>"Ef so be's ez you'se sot on it," Jim said, at
the end of the talk, "I vum I'll run the resk
with you. You ain't no ways fit to start off
alone. Ef you have to hist that thar tree into
the James River, you cudn't a-do it. I kin. 'N
ef you wuz all alonst, you mout fall off'n be
drownded. We-uns'll go together. 'N then I'll
hev a chanst to fight fer the old Union."</p>

<p>Tom was only too glad of the promised company.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
It was arranged that Jim was to come to
him as soon as possible after nightfall, with
whatever provisions he could lay his hands
upon, and that then they were to get away on
the queer craft Providence seemed to have prepared
for them, provided only that Providence
did not send the big tree swirling southward to
the sea before they could reach it. The river
was now considerably higher. It was tugging
hard at its prey. Sometimes the tree shook with
the impact of the rushing waves as if it had decided
to let go the sandbank forthwith. If it
did go before nightfall, they must try to find
another. There were always others in sight,
but they were far away in mid-channel, floating
swiftly seaward. How could one of these be
reached, if their fellow on the sandbank joined
them? There was nothing to be done, however,
except to wait. Tom's waiting was solaced by
the eating of the rest of the fish. Man and boy
agreed that the man must loiter there no longer.
Making a fire would delay him beyond roll-call.
So Jim went and Tom again ate raw fish, trying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to do so slowly, but not making a great success
of that. He felt as if he could eat a whale.</p>

<p>Darkness came only a few minutes before Jim
Grayson did. He brought with him a bundle of
food, upon part of which Tom forthwith supped.
He also brought his gun. "I'm a deserter now,
you see," he explained to the boy, "and I'll be
shot ef so be I'm caught. But ef I be caught,
I'll shoot some o' they-uns fust."</p>

<p>They could dimly see the outlines of the big
tree, now tossing in the waves that broke above
the submerged sandbank, as if it were struggling
to be free. They swam out to it, Jim strongly,
Tom weakly. They reached it none too soon.
Ten minutes later it would have started of its
own accord. Jim's task in "histing" it was
easy. They were afloat at once. The top of the
tree, a mass of bare branches, for the tiny tender
leaves of the early Southern spring had been
swept away by the water, formed the bow of
their craft. They both perched far back, leaning
against the tangled roots. Jim gave a final push
with one dangling foot and they were off. That
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
was all Tom knew for some time. He had fallen
asleep as soon as he had snuggled securely into
his place. He did not know it when they swept
through the cordon of patrol-boats below, which
hastened to give room to the vast battering ram.
He did not even know that Jim's arm held him
in place as the tree lurched and wobbled on its
downward road. A few hours afterwards, he
awoke, refreshed and hopeful, a new man, or
rather a new boy. The night was clear. The
outlines of both shores were visible. A young
moon added its feeble light to the brilliant radiance
of the stars.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" whispered Tom. He knew
the human voice carries a great distance over
water and while there seemed to be no one who
could overhear, he would run no unnecessary
risk.</p>

<p>"I never sailed no river before," Jim cheerily
answered, "'n I dun know nothin' 'bout the
Jeems River, but I 'low we've come 'bout a thousand
mile. 'N it's nigh sun-up. How'll we-uns
git to sho' 'n hide?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>"If we did that," said Tom, "we'd have to
give up our ship. Don't let us do that. Let's
say what Captain Lawrence said: 'Don't give
up the ship!' We'll call her the 'Liberty' and
sail her down to Hampton Roads. We can hide
in the branches or the roots if we meet anybody
on the river. Everybody will give us a wide
berth. We have some food, thanks to you.
Forty-eight hours more will see us through."</p>

<p>"All right, Captain," Jim Grayson replied.
"You're the commander."</p>

<p>Up to that time, the Confederate private had
been in command of the expedition, but now
that the Union officer was himself again, he took
charge of everything, much to Jim's content and
also, we must admit, much to Tom's content.</p>

<p>The good ship "Liberty," Tom Strong, captain,
Jim Grayson, mate, made a prosperous
voyage. Its crew was thoroughly scared three
or four times by the sight of Confederate craft,
small and large. When a gunboat selected it as
a floating target and plumped half-a-dozen cannon
balls around it, the crew thought the end
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
had come. But nobody on the gunboat saw the
two people cowering amid the branches of the
tree. The gunners were untrained. Their aim
was poor. And powder and cannon-balls were
not so abundant in the Confederacy that the
practice-firing could continue long. Early on
the third morning of the voyage, they were in
Hampton Roads, borne by the ebbing tide towards
the Union squadron that lay under the
guns of Fortress Monroe. As the sun rose
above the horizon, our flag sprang to the mastheads
of the ships. Tom felt like echoing Uncle
Mose's triumphant phrase: "De Stars 'n de
Stripeses, dey jest kivered de sky."</p>

<p>The "Liberty" would have gone straight out
to sea, so far as any control by its crew was concerned.
It did go out to sea, indeed, but not
until after Tom and Jim had been taken from
it by a boat from the Admiral's ship. Jim had
fired off his gun to attract attention, as the
"Liberty" neared the squadron, and then he
and Tom had both stood up on the teetering
trunk of their tree and shouted and waved their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
shirts, which they had taken off for that purpose,
as they had nothing else to wave, until
help came. The "Liberty" had brought them
to liberty. They said good-by to her almost
with regret. But their joy was deep when they
stood on the deck of the flagship, under the flag
of the free.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Towser Welcomes Tom to the White House&mdash;Lincoln

<p>The warmest welcome Tom had at the
White House was given him by Towser.
The next warmest was given him by Uncle
Moses and the next by Lincoln. The staff was
glad to see him back, but many of them were
jealous of the President's evident liking for him
and would not have sorrowed overmuch if he
had not come back at all. The patient President
found time, amid all his myriad cares, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
listen to Tom's story and to make Secretary
Stanton give a captain's commission to Jim
Grayson, who was sent to his own mountains to
gather recruits for the Union army. For
Towser, time existed only to be spent in welcoming
his young master home. He clung close
to him, with slobbering jaws and thumping tail,
through the first day, and the first night he
managed to escape from Uncle Mose's care in
the basement and to find Tom's attic room.
Thenceforth, as long as Tom stayed at the
White House, Towser stretched his yellow
bulk across the threshold of his door every
night and slept there the sleep of the utterly
happy.</p>

<p>There were no utterly happy men under the
White House roof. Lincoln's presidential term
was drawing to a close. He was renominated
by the Republicans, but his re-election at times
seemed impossible. The Democrats had put
forward Gen. George B. McClellan, once chief
commander of the Union forces, but a pitiful
failure as an aggressive general. A discontented
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
wing of the Republicans had nominated Gen.
John C. Fremont. Fremont had not fulfilled the
promise of his youth. At the beginning of the
war, he had been put in command at St. Louis,
had proved to be incompetent, and had been retired.
He was still strong in the hearts of many
people, but Lincoln feared the success, not of
Fremont, but of McClellan. John Hay once
said to the President:</p>

<p>"Fremont might be dangerous if he had more
ability and energy."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "he is like Jim Jett's
brother. Jim used to say that his brother was
the greatest scoundrel that ever lived, but in the
infinite mercy of Providence he was also the
greatest fool."</p>

<p>Family sayings, when they are not loving, are
apt to be bitter. One of the Vanderbilts said
of a connection of his by marriage that he was
"more kinds of a fool to the square inch than
anybody else in the world."</p>

<p>McClellan, who seemed practically certain of
success in August, 1864, was badly beaten in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
November, when the battle of parties was
fought out at the polls. Fremont had retired
from the contest early in the campaign. At the
first Cabinet meeting after the election, November
11, 1864, the President took a paper out of
his desk and said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, do you remember last summer
I asked you all to sign your names to the back
of a paper, of which I did not show you the
inside? This is it. Now, Mr. Hay, see if you
can get this open without tearing it."</p>

<p class="pmb1">Its cover was so thoroughly pasted up that it
had to be cut open. This done, Lincoln read it
aloud. Here it is:</p>

<div class="block2">

<p class="right">"Executive Mansion,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Washington, August 23, 1864.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>"This morning, as for some days past, it seems
exceedingly probable that this Administration
will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty
to so co-operate with the President elect as to
save the Union between the election and the inauguration;
as he will have secured his election
on such ground that he cannot possibly save it
afterwards.</p>

<p class="right pmb1"><span class="smcap">A. Lincoln</span>."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>In that memorandum is the sign-manual of a
great soul. Lincoln, believing his own defeat
was written in the stars, thought, not of himself,
but of how he, defeated, could best save the
cause of the Union from defeat. A small man
thinks first of himself. A big man thinks first
of his duty.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Life was happy at the White House now.
The President had been re-elected and it was
clear that long before his second term was over,
he would have won a victorious peace. The
South was still fighting with all the energy
brave men can show for a cause in the righteousness
of which they believe, but after all the
energy was that of despair. Grant was now in
supreme command of the Union forces, East and
West. He had been commissioned Lieutenant-General
and put in command March 17, 1864.
In commemoration of this event, the turning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
point in the great struggle, Lincoln had had a
photograph of himself taken. But two copies of
it were printed. One Lincoln kept himself. One
he gave Grant. Here is the one given Grant.</p>

  <span class="caption font08 smcap">ABRAHAM LINCOLN</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">The new Lieutenant-General was hammering
away at Richmond. The Mississippi, now under
Union control, cut the Confederacy in two. All
the chief Southern seaports, except Savannah
and Charleston, had been captured. And in this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
same month of November, 1864, Gen. William
Tecumseh Sherman, who ranked only second to
Grant in the United States army, cut loose from
Atlanta, Georgia, captured two months before
and began his famous march to the sea, with
Savannah as his destination. He illustrated his
own well-known saying: "War is hell." If it
was hell in Sherman's time, what word can
describe the horror of it in our day? He swept
with sword and fire a belt of fertile country,
sixty miles wide, from Atlanta to the sea. He
found it smiling and rich; he left it a bare and
blackened waste. He had destroyed the granary
of the Confederacy and before the next month
ended he had made his country a Christmas
present of the remaining chief Southern seaport,
Savannah. He wrote to Lincoln: "I beg to present
to you as a Christmas gift the city of
Savannah, with one hundred and fifty heavy
guns and plenty of ammunition and also twenty-five
thousand bales of cotton." Cotton was
worth a dollar a pound in those days.</p>

<p>Early in 1865 Sherman swung northward
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
from Savannah, forced the surrender of Charleston,
South Carolina, and joined Union forces
advancing from the North at Goldsboro', North
Carolina, March 23. Six days later Grant began
the final campaign against the Confederacy.
Six days before, Lincoln had said to the boy:</p>

<p>"Tom, would you like to see some more
fighting?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. President; very much."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't tell anybody, but I guess
there'll be some to see before long near Richmond.
I've had you ordered from special service
at the White House to special service with
the Lieutenant-General. Here's the order and
here's a letter to General Grant. I wouldn't
wonder if he put you on his staff."</p>

<p>"How can I thank you, Mr. Lincoln?"</p>

<p class="pmb2">"The best way to thank anybody is to do well
the work he gives you to do. Good-by, my son,
and good luck."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">With a pressure of Lincoln's huge hand Tom
was sped on his rejoicing way. Two days later
he was at Grant's headquarters, at City Point,
Virginia, near Fortress Monroe. He saluted
and handed the General Lincoln's letter. The
soldier sat, a silent sphinx, for a moment. Then
he looked up at Tom with a quizzical but not
unkindly smile, and said:</p>

<p>"Have you learned anything since you
brought me dispatches at Fort Donelson and
Vicksburg?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, General."</p>

<p>"Sometimes the President sends me people
for political reasons. I suppose he has to. But
I don't take them if I know it. Have you any
political influence behind you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, sir." Tom laughed at the
thought.</p>

<p>"You laugh well. You and Horace Porter
ought to get on together. He laughs well, too.
You can serve on my staff.</p>

<p>"I thank you, General."</p>

<p>Tom saluted and walked away, to find Horace
Porter, whom he found to be a very nice fellow
indeed. One of the first things the nice fellow
did for him was to get him a good horse. There
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
was no lack of horses at headquarters. The difficulty
was not to find one, but to choose the
best of many good ones. Tom, who had a good
eye for a horse, found one that exactly suited
him except as to color. He was of a mottled
gray. The boy did not much care for such a
color, but he knew it had its advantages. It
does not advertise its presence. Where a black,
a white or a bay horse would stand out and
make a mark for hostile sharpshooters, a mottled
gray might well elude their view. And the
horse, apart from this, was just what he wanted.
He paced fast, he galloped fast, and he walked
fast, which is a rare and precious accomplishment
in a horse. The average horse walks, as
a rule, slower than the average man. In an
hour, he covers a quarter-of-a-mile less ground.
One question remained to be settled.</p>

<p>"Can he jump?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Jump, is it?" answered the soldier-groom.
"Shure, the cow that jumped over the moon
couldn't lift a leg to him."</p>

<p class="pmb2">"You bet your life he can jump," said Horace
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Porter. "General Grant has ridden him twice
and I saw him put Bob over a fence or two."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/illo_298.jpg" width="600" height="375" alt="BOB" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08">BOB</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">Not long afterwards Tom did bet his life on
Bob's jumping. He was named Bob before the
United States took him. He had been captured
the month before and had come across the lines
with his name embroidered by some woman's
hand on his saddle-blanket and with his late
owner's blood upon his saddle. He was a tall,
leggy animal who showed a trace of Arabian
blood and who needed to be gentled a bit to get
his best work out of him. His mouth was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
appreciative of sugar and his eyes were appreciative
of kindness.</p>

<p>Both dogs and horses talk with their eyes.</p>

<p>"I like my new master," was what Bob's eyes
said to Tom.</p>

<p>It was through a chance suggestion of Colonel
Porter that the boy saw most of what he did see
of the final fight for freedom. Porter had presented
Tom to Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, who
was then at City Point, receiving Grant's final
instructions for the twelve-day campaign that
ended in the fall of Richmond and the surrender
of Lee's brave army. Sheridan was a stocky,
red-faced young Irishman, a graduate of West
Point, and a born leader of men, especially of
cavalrymen. He liked the clear-eyed lad who
stood respectfully before him. He had done too
much in his own youth to think Tom was useless
because he was so young. Porter saw that
the boy had made a good impression. He ventured
a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Why don't you take young Strong with you,
General?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Sheridan turned sharply to Tom, asking:</p>

<p>"Can you ride?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. I've ridden ever since I can
remember."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not so very long a time. But
I'll take your word for it. Would you like to go
with me?"</p>

<p>"I'd like it better than anything else in the
world, General."</p>

<p>Tom had rejoiced in the idea of being with
Grant, but he knew that the commander-in-chief
must stay behind his lines and that his
staff could catch but glimpses of the fighting,
when they were sent forward with orders,
whereas with Sheridan he might be in the very
thick of the fighting itself. His ready answer
and the joy that beamed in his eyes pleased the
fighting Irishman.</p>

<p>"Can I borrow him of General Grant?"
Sheridan asked Porter.</p>

<p>"I'll answer for that," Porter replied. "The
General told me to put Strong to whatever work
I could find for him to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come ahead," said Sheridan. "You'll see
some beautiful fighting!"</p>

<p>Sheridan loved fighting, but he made no pretense
of never being afraid. He thought a general
should be close to the front, to keep his
soldiers' spirits high.</p>

<p>"Are you never afraid?" Charles A. Dana,
then Assistant Secretary of War, once asked
him.</p>

<p>"If I was, I should not be ashamed of it. If I
should follow my natural impulse, I should run
away always at the beginning of the danger.
The men who say they are never afraid in a battle
do not tell the truth."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="pmb2">March 29, 1865, the twelve-day campaign began.
The cavalry swung out towards Five
Forks, where Lee's right wing lay behind deep
entrenchments. April 1, Sheridan attacked in
force. Americans fought Americans with stubborn
bravery on both sides. The issue was long
in doubt. Sheridan and his staff were close to
the firing-line, so that Tom had but a few hundred
yards to gallop under fire when his general
said to him:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">"Tell General Griffin to charge and keep
charging."</p>

<p>Griffin's order to his troops was so quickly
given that it seemed an echo of the order Tom
brought him. It was the boy's business to return
forthwith and report upon his mission, but
he simply couldn't do it. There were the Confederate
lines manned with hungry soldiers in
the remnants of their gray uniforms, the Stars-and-Bars
flying above them. And there were
battalions of blue-clad cavalry, men and horses
in prime condition, straining to start like hounds
upon a leash. Griffin's order was the electric
spark that fired the battery. The men shouted
with joy as they spurred their horses into a mad
gallop. The shout was answered by the shrill
"rebel yell" from the dauntless foe in the
trenches. The charging column shook the
ground. In its foremost files rode Second-lieutenant
Tom Strong, forgetful of everything
else in the world but the joy of battle. Musketry
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
and artillery tore bloody lanes in the close-packed
column. Men and horses fell in heaps
upon the blood-stained ground. But the column
went on. At dusk of that April day it poured
over the parapets so bravely held. Even then
the fight was not over. There was still stout
resistance. The two armies were a mass of
struggling men, shooting, stabbing, striking.
The battle had become a series of duels man to
man. Tom, pistol in hand, rode at a big Kentuckian,
but the gray-clad giant dodged the bullet,
caught his own unloaded musket by the
muzzle, and dealt the boy a blow with its butt
that knocked him off his horse and left him
senseless on the ground.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, when he came to his
senses, he felt as if he were a boy annexed to a
shoulder twice as big as all the rest of his body.
It was on his shoulder that the blow of the
clubbed musket had gone home. The fall from
his horse had stunned him. Bob was standing
over him, as Black Auster stood over Herminius,
nuzzling at the outstretched hand of this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
silent, motionless thing that had been his
master. They had been together for less than
a week, but a day is often long enough for a
horse to find out that his master is his friend.
Tom had been more careful of his horse's comfort
than of his own. Now the good gray had
stood by him and over him, perhaps saving him
from being trampled to death in that fierce last
act of the Drama of Five Forks. Bob whinnied
with joy as Tom's eyes slowly opened again.
He thrust his muzzle down along the boy's
cheek and the boy caught hold of the flowing
mane with his right hand and pulled himself
upon his feet again. His left arm hung useless
by his side. One glance told him the battle was
won. The duels were over. The Confederates
were in full retreat. A stream of prisoners was
already flowing by him. He mounted and followed
it to Sheridan's headquarters. There the
skillful fingers of a surgeon found that no bones
were broken. The swollen shoulder was dressed
and bandaged. The healthy blood that filled
Tom's veins did much to make a speedy cure.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
So did the joy of victory. Sheridan had done
what Grant had given him to do. He had
driven back Lee's right flank and cut the railroad
by which Lee must escape from Richmond,
if escape he could.</p>

<p>Richmond was doomed. The next morning,
Sunday, April 2, 1865, Jefferson Davis, President
of the Confederate States of America, sat
in his pew in St. Paul's Church, Richmond. The
solemn service began. Soon there was a stir at
the door, a rustle, a turning of heads away from
the chancel, where the gray-haired rector stood.
Swiftly a messenger came up the aisle. Davis
rose from his knees to receive the message. The
service stopped. Every eye was bent upon the
leader of the Lost Cause. He put on his spectacles,
opened the missive, and read it amid a
breathless silence. It told him that the Cause
was lost indeed. It was from Lee, who wrote:
"My lines are broken in three places. Richmond
must be evacuated this evening." There
was no sign of feeling upon Jefferson Davis's
impassive face, as he read the fateful dispatch.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Without a word, without a sign, he left the
church with the wife whose utter devotion had
helped him bear the burden of those terrible
years, during which proud hope gradually gave
way to sickening fear. Davis was not of those
weak men who despair. There was still a little
hope in his heart, despite the tremendous blow
Lee's letter had dealt him. He walked down
the aisle with head as high as though he were
marching to assured victory. But through the
congregation there ran the whisper "Richmond
is to be evacuated." A panic-stricken mob
poured out of the church with faltering steps
behind Jefferson Davis's firm, proud ones.
Early that afternoon the Confederate Government
fled. Early the next morning, Monday,
April 3, 1865, Gen. Godfrey Weitzel marched
his negro troops into the Confederate capital.
The flag of the free floated from the dome of
the Statehouse, which almost from the earliest
days of the war had sheltered what was now
indeed the Lost Cause. It was raised there by
Lieut. Johnston L. De Peyster, a youth of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
eighteen, who had carried it wrapped around the
pommel of his saddle for some days, hoping for
the chance that now came to him. The second
Union flag that was raised that day in Richmond
was over Libby. The prison gates gave up their
prey. The prisoners poured out, some too weak
to do more than smile, others in a frenzy of
joy. Major Hans Rolf, reduced by hunger to a
long lath of a man, had lost none of his spirit.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," he shouted, "three times three
for the old flag!"</p>

<p>The cheers rang out in a feeble chorus and
then there rang out Han's contagious laughter.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" he roared. "We're free, boys,
we're free."</p>

<p>By that Sunday night, the fate of Petersburg
was sealed. Grant had ordered an assault in
force at six o'clock Monday morning, but the
Confederates abandoned their works in the gray
dawn and our troops met little resistance in taking
over the town. "General Meade and I,"
says General Grant in his "Personal Memoirs,"
"entered Petersburg on the morning of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
third and took a position under cover of a house
which protected us from the enemy's musketry
which was flying thick and fast there. As we
would occasionally look around the corner, we
could see ... the Appomattox bottom ...
packed with the Confederate army.... I had
not the heart to turn the artillery upon such a
mass of defeated and fleeing men and I hoped
to capture them soon."</p>

<p>"Let us follow up Lee," Meade suggested.
He was a better follower than a fighter. He had
followed Lee before, from Gettysburg to Richmond,
without ever attacking him.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," Grant replied, "we will
cut off his retreat by occupying the Danville railroad
and capture him. He must get to his food
to keep his troops alive. We will get between
him and his food."</p>

<p>With constant fighting this was done. By
Wednesday, April 5, the Union lines were drawn
about the Confederate army. Sheridan, hampered
by Meade's slowness, was urgent that
Grant should come to the front. He sent message
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
after message to that effect to Grant on
Wednesday. A scout in gray uniform was entrusted
with the second message. He was made
up to look like a Confederate scout, but he was
Tom Strong. He had put on his disguise at
Sheridan's headquarters. As he stood at attention
to receive his orders, Sheridan laughed and
said:</p>

<p>"You make a good 'Johnny Reb.' Do you
chew tobacco?"</p>

<p>Surprised at the question, Tom said he didn't.</p>

<p>"Well, you may have to begin the habit today.
You're to take this message to General Grant.
If you're caught, chew it&mdash;and swallow it quick."</p>

<p>He handed the boy a bit of tinfoil. It looked
like a small package of chewing-tobacco, but it
contained a piece of tissue-paper upon which
Sheridan's message was written.</p>

<p>The ride from the left flank to the center was
not without danger. Tom, duly provided with
the password, could go by any Union forces
without difficulty, but the country swarmed
with Confederates, some of them deserters,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
many of them straggling detachments cut off
from the main army and seeking to rejoin it, all
of them more than ready to capture a Union
soldier and his horse.</p>

<p>The boy climbed a little clumsily into the saddle.
His left shoulder still felt like a big balloon
stuffed full of pain. But there was nothing
clumsy in his seat, as Bob shot off like an arrow
at the touch of Tom's heel on his flank. It was
a beautiful, bright April morning, too beautiful
a day for men to be killing each other. Evidently,
however, it did not seem so to the commander
of a company of Confederate cavalry,
who had laid an ambush into which Tom gayly
galloped. He heard a sharp order to halt. He
saw men ride across the road in front of him.
He whirled about, only to see the road behind
him blocked. He was fairly trapped. But there
was one chance of escaping from the trap and
Tom took it. His would-be captors had come
from the left of the road, its northern side, for
he was traveling east. On the south was a high
rail-fence, laid in the usual zigzags, one of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
few which had not fed the camp-fires of Northern
Virginia. It was a good five feet high; it was
only a few feet away; Bob was standing still
for a second in slippery mud. It was not at all
the kind of place to select for a jump, but the
Confederates had selected the place, not Tom.
He remembered Colonel Porter's saying "You
can bet your life Bob can jump," and he bet his
life on Porter's being right. He put Bob at
the fence. The gallant gray, as if he sensed his
master's danger, took one bound toward the
rails, gathered himself together into a tense
mass of muscle, and rose into the air like a bird.
As he flew over the top-rail, carbines cracked behind
him, but as he leaped southward across the
countryside, a ringing cheer followed him too.
The brave Southerners rejoiced in the brave feat
that took their captive into freedom. Their jaded
horses could not follow. There was no pursuit.</p>

<p>It took Tom some hours to double back towards
Grant's headquarters. He met long lines
of Union cavalry, infantry, and artillery pressing
forward to strengthen Sheridan's forces. They
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
were going west and they choked every road
and lane and path by which the boy sought to go
east. They had begun their march at three
o'clock that morning. They had had no breakfast.
They carried no food. Their wagon-trains
were miles in the rear. It was their fourth day
of continuous fighting. They had a right to be
tired, but they were not tired. They had a right
to be hungry, but they were not hungry. When
the air was full of victory, what did an empty
stomach matter? Cheering and singing, they
swept along. The end of four years' fighting
was in sight. The hunted foe was trying to
slink away to safety, as many a fox, with hounds
and huntsmen closing in upon him, had tried to
do on these Virginian fields. Never were huntsmen
more anxious to be "in at the death" than
were those joyous Union soldiers on that memorable
April day.</p>

<p>It was nearly night when the boy reached
headquarters, saluted the commander-in-chief,
said "A message from General Sheridan," and
handed over the little tinfoil package.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can go back with me," said Grant.
"That horse of yours is Bob, isn't it?" Grant
never forgot a horse he had once ridden.</p>

<p>Within an hour the General and his staff, with
a small cavalry escort, started for Sheridan's
headquarters. By ten that night the two were
together. Sheridan was almost crying over the
orders Meade had given him. By midnight
Sheridan was happy. "I explained to Meade,"
say the "Personal Memoirs," "that we did not
want to follow the enemy; we wanted to get
ahead of him; and that his orders would allow
the enemy to escape.... Meade changed his
orders at once."</p>

<p>That change of orders incidentally put Tom
Strong the next day into the hottest fight of his
life. This was the battle of Sailor's Creek, almost
forgotten since amid the mightier happenings
of that wonderful April week, but never
forgotten by Tom Strong. Our forces had attacked
Lee's retreating legions, retreating toward
the provision trains that were their only
hope of food. The fight was fierce. We had
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
attacked with both infantry and cavalry, but our
gallant fellow-countrymen held their lines unbroken.
Then with a thunder of wheels our
field artillery came into action. The Confederate
guns were shelling the hillside up which the
plunging horses drew our cannon. There were
six horses in each team, an artilleryman riding
each near horse and holding the off horse of
the pair by a bridle. Tom had come up with
orders and was standing by General Wright as
the guns bounded up the hillside. Bob stood
behind his master, whinnying a bit with excitement.</p>

<p>General Wright snapped his watch shut impatiently.</p>

<p>"They're ten minutes late," he complained.
"We're beaten if we don't get 'em into action
instantly. Good Heavens! there goes our first
gun to destruction!"</p>

<p>A Confederate shell had struck and burst
close to the leaders. A fragment of it swept the
foremost rider from his seat and from life. The
two horses he had handled reared, plunged,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
jumped to one side. The six horses were huddled
into a frightened heap. The two other soldiers
could do nothing with the leaders out of
control. The gun stopped short. And behind it
stopped all of one of the two lines of advancing
artillery.</p>

<p>"Take that gun into action!"</p>

<p class="pmb2">Tom heard the General's brief command and
ran toward the huddled horses. He sprang into
the saddle, seized both bridles, and drove on.
As he did so, another Confederate shell burst
beside the off horse. Its fragments spared the
foremost rider this time, but they dealt death
to one of his two comrades. The man in control
of the wheelers threw his right arm out and
toppled over into the road, dead before the
heavy cannon-wheel crashed and crushed over
him. The leaders, so skillfully handled that
their very fear made them run more madly into
danger, tore ahead, keeping the other four
horses galloping behind them, until the gun was
in position. It roared the news of its coming
with a well-aimed shot into the midst of the
enemy's forces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

  <span class="caption font08 smcap">Tom Takes a Battery Into Action</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Its fellows fell into line and
followed suit. The infantry and cavalry attacked
with renewed spirit. Sullenly and savagely,
fighting until darkness forbade more
fighting, Lee's troops withdrew towards the
west, with the Union forces pounding away at
them. They left a mass of dead upon the battlefield,
lives finely lost for the Lost Cause, and
they also left as prisoners six general officers
and seven thousand men. More than a third of
all the prisoners taken in the battles before the
final surrender were taken at the battle of
Sailor's Creek. Tom had stuck to his new arm
of the service through the three hours of fighting.
The guns had been continually advanced
as the Southerners retreated. They had been
continually under fire. Nearly half the gunners
had been killed or wounded. When the fight
was over, Tom remembered for the first time his
own wounded shoulder. He had never thought
of it from the moment when he had sprung upon
the artillery horse. Now it began to throb with
a renewed and a deeper pain, as if resenting his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
ignoring of it so long, but the new pain also
vanished when he rejoined General Wright and
heard him say:</p>

<p>"Mr. Strong, you helped to save the day.
I shall recommend you for promotion for distinguished
bravery under fire."</p>

<p>The boy saluted, his heart too full to speak.
As he rode away upon Bob, some of the joy
in his heart must have got into Bob's heels, for
Bob pirouetted up the main street of the little
town of Farmville, late that night, as though he
were prouder than ever of his master.</p>

<p class="pmb1">Farmville was now headquarters. Grant was
there, in a bare hotel, not long before a Confederate
hospital. It was from the Farmville hotel
that he wrote to Lee a historic note. It ran
thus:</p>

<div class="block2">
<p class="right">
"Headquarters Armies of the U. S.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, April 7, 1865.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p class="left">
"General R. E. Lee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanding C. S. A.:<br />
</p>

<p>The results of the last week must convince
you of the hopelessness of further resistance on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the part of the Army of Northern Virginia in
this struggle. I feel that it is so, and regard it
as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility
of any further effusion of blood by asking
of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate
States army known as the Army of
Northern Virginia.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">U. S. Grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>,<br />
Lieut.-General."&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">Under a flag of truce, this note reached General
Lee that evening, so near together were the
headquarters of the contending armies in those
last days. His letter in reply, asking what terms
of surrender were offered, reached Grant the
next morning while he was talking on the steps
of the Farmville hotel to a Confederate Colonel.</p>

<p>"Jes' tho't I'd repo't to you, General," said
the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You see I own this hyar hotel you're
a-occupyin'."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we shall move out soon. We are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
moving around a good deal, nowadays. Why
aren't you with your regiment?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, General, I am my regiment."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"All the men wuz raised 'round hyar. A few
days ago they jes' begun nachally droppin' out.
They all dun dropped out, General, so I jes'
tho't there wan't any use being a cunnel without
no troops and I dun dropped out too. Here
I be? What you goin' to do with me, General?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave you here to take care of
your property. Don't go back to your army and
nobody'll bother you."</p>

<p>That was a sample of the way in which the
beaten army was melting away. Not even the
magic of Lee's great name could hold it together
now. But the men who did not drop out fought
with heroism to the bitter end.</p>

<p>The next day, Saturday, April 8, 1865,
Sheridan captured some more of Lee's provision
trains at Appomattox Station and on Sunday,
April 9, Lee's whole army attacked there,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
still seeking to cut its way out of its encircling
foes. Its brave effort was in vain. Held in a
vice, it threw up its hands. A white flag flew
above the Confederate lines.</p>

<p>Grant had spent Saturday night struggling
with a sick headache, his feet in hot water and
mustard, his wrists and the back of his neck covered
with mustard-plasters. On Sunday morning,
still sick and suffering, he was jogging along
on horseback towards the front, when a Confederate
officer was brought before him. He carried
a note from Lee offering to surrender.
"When the officer reached me," writes Grant,
"I was still suffering with the sick headache;
but the instant I saw the contents of the note,
I was cured." The ending of the war ended
Grant's headache.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two commanders met at Appomattox
Court House, a sleepy Virginian village, five
miles from the railroad and endless miles from
the great world. It lies in a happy valley, not
wrapped in happiness that April day, for Sheridan's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
forces held the crest at the south and Lee's
were deployed along the hilltop to the north. A
two-hour armistice had been granted. If that
did not bring the end desired, that end was to
be fought out with all the horrors of warfare
amid the peaceful houses that had straggled together
to make the peaceful little town.</p>

<p>At the northern end of the village street, surrounded
by an apple orchard, stood a two-story
brick house with a white wooden piazza in front
of it. It was the home of Wilmer McLean, a
Virginia farmer upon whose farm part of the
battle of Bull Run had been fought at the outbreak
of the war. Foreseeing that other battles
might be fought there&mdash;as the second battle of
Bull Run, in 1862, was&mdash;he had sold his property
there and had moved by a strange chance
to the very village and the very house in which
the final scene of the great tragedy of this war
between brothers was to be played. Here Lee
awaited Grant.</p>

<p class="pmb2">The Union general had gone to Sheridan's
headquarters before riding up to the McLean
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
house. Sheridan and his staff had gone on with
him. Least important of the little group of
Union officers who followed Grant into the
presence of Lee was Tom Strong, but the boy's
heart beat as high as that of any man there.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
  <img src="images/illo_326.jpg" width="600" height="450" alt="THE McLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08 smcap">The McLeanN House, Appomattox Courthouse</span>
</div>

<p class="p2 pmb2">It was in the orchard about the house that
the myth of "the apple-tree of Appomattox"
was born. Millions of men and women have
believed that Lee surrendered to Grant under an
apple tree at Appomattox. That apple tree is
   <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
as famous in mistaken history as is that other
mythical tree, the cherry tree which George
Washington did not cut down with his little
hatchet. Washington could not tell a lie, it is
true, but he never chopped down a cherry tree
and then said to his angry, questioning father:
"Father, I cannot tell a lie; I cut it down with
my little hatchet." That fairy story came from
the imagination of one Parson Weems, who did
not resemble our first President in the latter's
inability to tell lies. Perhaps the myth of the
apple tree will never die, as the myth of the
cherry tree has never died. In 1880, when
Grant's mistaken friends tried to nominate him
for a third Presidential term, other candidates
had been urged because this one, it was said,
could carry Ohio, that one Maine, and so on.
Then Roscoe Conkling of New York strode
upon the stage to nominate Grant and declaimed
to a hushed audience of twenty thousand men:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And if you ask what State <i>he</i> comes from,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our sole reply shall be:</span><br />
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">He</span> comes from Appomattox</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the famous apple tree!"</span><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The twenty thousand were swept off their feet
by the magic of that myth. Grant was almost
nominated&mdash;but not quite.</p>

<p>The historic interview began in the room to
the left of the front door in the McLean house.
Two very different figures confronted each
other. Grant had not expected the meeting to
take place so soon and had left the farmhouse
where he had spent the night before in rough
garb. He writes: "I was without a sword, as
I usually was when on horseback in the field,
and wore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the
shoulder-straps of my rank to indicate to the
army who I was.... General Lee was
dressed in a full uniform, which was entirely
new, and was wearing a sword of considerable
value, very likely the sword which had been presented
by the State of Virginia.... In my
rough traveling suit, the uniform of a private
with the straps of a lieutenant-general, I must
have contrasted very strangely with a man so
handsomely dressed, six feet high and of faultless
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
form. But this was not a matter that I
thought of until afterwards."</p>

<p class="pmb2">Lee requested that the terms to be given his
army should be written out. Grant asked General
Parker of his staff, a full-blooded American
Indian, for writing materials. He had prepared
nothing beforehand, but he knew just what he
wanted to say and he wrote without hesitation
terms such as only a great and magnanimous
nation could offer its conquered citizens. After
providing for the giving of paroles (that is, an
agreement not to take up arms again unless the
paroled prisoner is later exchanged for a prisoner
of the other side) and for the surrender of
arms, artillery, and public property, he added:
"This will not embrace the sidearms of the officers
nor their private horses or baggage. This
done, each officer and man will be allowed to
return to their homes, not to be disturbed by
United States authority so long as they observe
their paroles and the laws in force where they
reside." There are some mistakes in grammar
in these words, but there are no mistakes in
magnanimity. When Lee, having put on his
glasses, had read the first sentence quoted
above, he said with feeling:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
  <img src="images/illo_330.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="Lee Surrenders to Grant" title="" />
  <span class="caption font08 smcap">Lee Surrenders to Grant</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">"This will have a happy effect upon my
army."</p>

<p class="pmb2">He went on to say that many of the privates
in the Confederate cavalry and artillery owned
their own horses; could they retain them?
Grant did not change the written terms, but he
said his officers would be instructed to let every
Confederate private who claimed to own a horse
or mule take the animal home with him. "It
was doubtful," writes Grant, "whether they
would be able to put in a crop to carry themselves
and their families through the next winter
without the aid of the horses they were then
riding." Again Lee remarked that this would
have a happy effect. He then wrote and signed
an acceptance of the proposed terms of surrender.
The war was over. The first act of
peace was our issuing 25,000 rations to the army
we had captured. For some days it had lived
on parched corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

  <span class="caption font08">GEN. U. S. GRANT</span>
</div>

<p class="p2">The news of the surrender flashed along the
waiting lines like wildfire and the Union forces
began firing a salute of a hundred guns in honor
of the victory. "I at once sent word," says
Grant, "to have it stopped. The Confederates
were now our prisoners and we did not want to
exult over their downfall." This was the spirit
of a great man and of a great nation. It was
not the soldiers who fought the war who kept
its rancors alive after peace had come, It was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
the politicians, who tore open the old wounds
and kept the country bleeding for a dozen years
after the Lost Cause was lost.</p>

<p>On the morning of Tuesday, April 10, 1865,
Grant and Lee again met between the lines and
sitting on horseback talked for half an hour.
Then Grant began his journey to Washington.
His staff, including Tom, went with him. When
they reached their goal, Second-Lieutenant
Strong found he was that no longer. For General
Wright had done what he had told Tom
he meant to do. The recommendation had been
heeded. Lincoln himself handed the boy his
new commission as a brevet-captain.</p>

<p>"I was glad to sign that, Tom," the President
told him, "and even Stanton didn't kick this
time."</p>

<p>"You don't know how glad I am to get it,
Mr. President," was the reply. "Now I'm a
boy-captain, as my great-grandfather was before
me."</p>

<p>"I'm not much on pedigrees and ancestry and
genealogical trees, my boy," answered Lincoln.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
"Out West we think more of trees that grow
out of the ground than we do of trees that grow
on parchment. But you're right to be proud of
an ancestry of service to your country. When
family pride is based on money or land or social
standing, it is one of the most foolish things
God Almighty ever laughed at, but when it is
based on service, real service, to your country,
to your fellowmen, to the world, why, then,
Tom, it's one of the biggest and best things in
God's kingdom. But remember this, son,"&mdash;Lincoln's
eyes flashed in their deep sockets&mdash;"if
a boy has an ancestor who has done big
things, the way to be proud of him is to do big
things yourself. Living on the glory of what
somebody else has done before you is a mighty
poor kind of living. I never knew but one man
that was perfect and I'd never have known he
was if he hadn't told me so. Nobody else ever
found it out. But if we can't be perfect, we can
grow less imperfect by trying every day to serve
our fellowmen. Remember that, Tom."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>On the evening of Good Friday, April 14,
1865, Laura Keene, an English actress of
great repute in America, was to play <i>Our American
Cousin</i> at Ford's Theater, the chief place of
amusement for war-time Washington.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Assistant-Secretary-of-War
Dana was notified by wire that Jacob Thompson
of Mississippi, once Secretary of the Interior
under our poor old wavering President,
Buchanan, afterwards a leading Secessionist,
would take a steamship for England that
evening at Portland, Maine.</p>

<p>"What shall I do?" Dana asked Stanton.</p>

<p>"Arrest him! No, wait; better go over and
see the President."</p>

<p>So Dana went to the White House. Office-hours
were over. He found Lincoln washing his
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Halloo, Dana!" was Lincoln's greeting.
"What's up?"</p>

<p>The telegram was read aloud.</p>

<p>"What does Stanton say?"</p>

<p>"He says to arrest him, but that I should
refer the question to you."</p>

<p>"Well, no, I rather think not. When you
have got an elephant by the hind legs and he's
trying to run away; it's best to let him run."</p>

<p>Dana reported this to Stanton.</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff!" said Stanton.</p>

<p>But Thompson was not arrested, so that the
last recorded act of Lincoln as President was
one of mercy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the upper stage-box, to the right of the
audience, that evening, sat Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States, Mrs. Lincoln, a
friend, Miss Harris, and an officer, Major Henry
R. Rathbone. The cares of State seemed to
have slipped for the moment from Lincoln's
shoulders. He had bowed smilingly from the
box in response to the cheers of the packed audience
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
in the body of the house. He had followed
intently the action of the amusing play, constantly
smiling, often applauding. The eyes of
the little party of four were bent upon the stage,
about ten o'clock, when the door of the box was
jerked violently open behind them. As they
turned at the noise, Death stalked in upon
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Five minutes before, Tom Strong had been
idly strolling along Tenth Street and had paused
at the theater door to read the play-bills posted
there. A small group of belated play-goers was
at the ticket-booth. A man shoved roughly
through them. A woman's "Oh!" of surprise
and protest drew Tom's attention to the man.
He had seen him but thrice before, yet the man's
face was engraved upon his memory. Once, at
Charlestown, Virginia, Wilkes Booth had stood
in the ranks of the militia, eagerly awaiting the
execution of John Brown. Once, upon a railroad
train north of Baltimore, Wilkes Booth had
drugged the boy and left him, as the scoundrel
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
thought, to die. Once, upon a railroad platform
at Kingston, Alabama, Wilkes Booth had recognized
him and had again sought his death.
Whose death did he seek to compass now?
What was the Confederate spy doing here?
Tom had scarcely glimpsed the hawk-like features,
the pallid face, the flowing black hair of
his foe, when Booth disappeared from his sight
in the crowded lobby of the theater.</p>

<p>Instantly Tom pursued him. But he was delayed
by the little group through whom Booth
had elbowed his rough way. And when he
reached the ticket-window, he found no money
in his pocket with which to buy admittance. He
had put on civilian clothes that evening and had
left his scanty store of currency in his uniform.
The wary ticket-seller, used to all sorts of
dodges by people who wanted to get in without
paying, laughed at his story and refused to give
him a ticket on trust. Tom's claim that he was
an officer caused especial amusement.</p>

<p>"That won't go down, bub," said the ticket-seller.
"Try to think up a better lie next time.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
And clear out now. Don't block up the passageway."</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> get in," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You shan't," snarled the man, sure that he
was being imposed upon.</p>

<p>The doorkeeper, attracted by the little row,
had come towards the ticket-window. He
swung his right arm with a threatening gesture.
As Tom started towards him he struck the
threatened blow, but his clenched fist hit nothing.
The boy had ducked under his arm and
had fled into the theater. The doorkeeper pursued
him. But Tom was now making his way
like a weasel through the crowd. He had
caught sight of Wilkes Booth nearly at the top
of the right-hand staircase that led to the aisle
from which the upper right-hand box was
reached. Without any actual premonition of
the coming tragedy which was to echo around
the world upon the morrow, he still felt that
Booth had in mind some evil deed and that it
was his duty to prevent him. As he struggled
toward the foot of the stairway, Booth saw
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
him, recognized him and smiled at him, a smile
of triumphant hideous evil. Tom yelled:</p>

<p>"Spy! Confederate spy! Stop him! Let
me follow!"</p>

<p>Upon the startled crowd there fell a sudden
stillness. Nobody laid hand upon Booth, but
everybody made way for the frantic boy who
rushed up the stairway as the scoundrel he
chased ran down the corridor. He clutched the
newel post at the head of the stairway just as
Booth flung open the door of the box. Tom
ran towards him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The door of the box was violently jerked
open. Wilkes Booth sprang across the
threshold. He put his pistol close to the head
of the unarmed man he meant to murder. He
fired. The greatest American sank forward
into his wife's arms. High above her shrieks
rose the actor's trained voice. He leaped upon
the balustrade of the box, shouted "<i>Sic semper
tyrannis!</i>" and jumped down to the stage. He
was booted and spurred for his escape. His
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
horse was held for him near the stage-door.
One of his spurs caught upon the curtain of the
box, so that he stumbled and fell heavily. But
he had played his part upon that stage many a
time before. He knew every nook and cranny
of the mysterious labyrinth behind the footlights.
He rose to his feet, disregarding a
twisted ankle, and rushed to safety&mdash;for a few
hours. He reached his horse and galloped into
the calm night of God, profaned forever by this
hideous crime of a besotted fanatic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The martyred President was taken to a neighboring
house, No. 453 Tenth Street. In a back
hall bedroom, upon the first floor, that that was
still Abraham Lincoln, but was soon to cease
to be so, was laid upon a narrow bed. Tom had
helped to carry him there. Wife and son, John
Hay, Secretary-of-War Stanton, and a few
others crowded into the tiny room. Doctors
worked feverishly over the dying man. Their
skill was in vain. The slow and regular breathing
grew fainter. The automatic moaning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
ceased. A look of unspeakable peace came to
the face the world now knows so well. In a
solemn hush, at twenty-two minutes after seven
in the morning of Saturday, April 15, 1865, the
great soul of Abraham Lincoln went back to
the God Who had given him to America and to
the world. A moment later Stanton spoke:</p>

<p>"Now he belongs to the ages."</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The assassination of Lincoln was not the
only crime that stained that memorable
night. Secretary-of-State Seward was stabbed
in his sick-bed by one of Booth's co-conspirators.
Attempts were made upon the lives of other
Cabinet ministers. Many arbitrary arrests had
been made during the war by Secretary Stanton.
It had been said that whenever Stanton's little
bell rang, somebody went to prison. That little
bell had little rest this Saturday. Wholesale
arrests were made of suspected Southern sympathizers
who might have known something of
the hideous conspiracy of murder. Stanton put
all the grim energy of him into the pursuit of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the leading criminals. He was said never to
forget anything. One of the things he had not
forgotten was that Tom Strong knew Wilkes
Booth by sight. He sent him from Lincoln's
bedside, hours before Lincoln died, to join a
troop of cavalry that was to pursue Booth. The
road by which the murderer had left Washington
was known. Hard upon his heels rode the
avengers of crime. Wherever there was a light
in one of the few houses along the lonely road,
often where there was no light, the occupants
were seized, questioned, sometimes sent to
Washington under guard, sometimes released
and sternly bidden to say nothing of the midnight
ride. Piecing together scraps of information
gathered here and there, studying every
crossroad for possible hoof-marks of flight, the
silent commander of the cavalrymen at last convinced
himself that he was on the trail of the
quarry. The troops broke into full gallop. A
few minutes before dawn they reached a small
village on the bank of the Potomac, where the
fires of a smithy gleamed. They pulled up short
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
as the startled blacksmith came out of his sooty
shed.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" demanded the
captain.</p>

<p>"I've been&mdash;I've been&mdash;putting on a horseshoe,
sir."</p>

<p>"For what kind of a looking man?"</p>

<p>"He said his name was Barnard."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said Tom from his
saddle, "but Barnard was the name Wilkes
Booth once gave me for his own." At the beginning
of the ride, Tom had described Booth's
appearance to the captain.</p>

<p>"Was the man pale? Did he have long black
hair?"</p>

<p>"Long black hair," answered the blacksmith,
"but his cheeks were red. He seemed excited.
While I was replacing the shoe his horse had
cast, he kept drinking brandy from a bottle he
carried. He never gave me none of it," the
man added with an injured air.</p>

<p>"Did he say anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He said I'd hear great news later
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
today, that the Southerners had won their
greatest victory. I asked him where and he
swore at me and told me to shut up. But he
gave me a silver dollar. Perhaps it's bad.
Is it?"</p>

<p>The blacksmith pulled out of his grimy pocket
a dollar and showed it to the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you know who that man was?" was the
stern command.</p>

<p>"No, sir, o' course I don't. I s'pose he was
Mr. Barnard."</p>

<p>"He was Judas. He has murdered Abraham
Lincoln. And he has given you one of the forty
pieces of silver."</p>

<p>With wild-eyed horror, the smith started
back. He flung the accursed dollar far into the
Potomac.</p>

<p>"God's curse go with it," he cried. "Captain,
the man went straight down the river road.
He gave his horse a cut with his whip 'n he
yelled 'Carry me back to ole Virginny!' and
he went off lickety-split. He ain't half-an-hour
ahead of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>No need to command full speed now. Every
man was riding hard. Every horse was putting
his last ounce of strength into his stride. Within
an hour, the hounds saw the slinking fox they
chased. Booth, abandoning his exhausted steed,
took refuge in a tumble-down barn. A cordon
was thrown about it and he was called on to
surrender. The reply was a shot. Tom heard
the whiz of the bullet as it tore by him. The
cavalry pumped lead into the barn. Once,
twice, thrice they fired. At the first volley, the
trapped murderer had again fired. There was no
answer to the second and third. With reloaded
carbines, the troopers charged, burst open the
barred door, and rushed into the rickety shed.
A man lay on the earthen floor, breath and
blood struggling together in his gaping mouth.
As they gathered about him, the Captain
asked:</p>

<p>"Do you know this man, Captain Strong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Wilkes Booth, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>The sound of his own name half recalled
Booth to life. He looked up at the boy who
stood beside him and recognized him. Ferocious
hate filled the glazing eyes. Then Wilkes
Booth went to his eternal doom, hating to the
end.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" said the Captain, turning to a
major of the medical service, who had galloped
beside Tom on that fierce ride of the avengers.
A big, bearded man knelt beside the body of
Wilkes Booth, put his finger where the pulse
had been and laid his hand where the heart had
once beat.</p>

<p>"He is dead," answered Major Hans Rolf.</p>

<p>His body was thrust somewhere into the earth
he had disgraced or else was flung, weighted
with stones, into the river, all the flood tides of
which could not wash away the black guilt of
him. No man knows where the body of Wilkes
Booth was buried.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"The king is dead! Long live the king!"</p>

<p>When Tom rode sadly up Pennsylvania Avenue,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
with a crape-laden flag at half-mast over
the Capitol, glad for the stern justice that had
been dealt out to the murderer he loathed, but
bowed down with grief for the murdered President
he had loved, Abraham Lincoln was no
longer President of the United States. In his
stead, our uncrowned king was Andrew Johnson,
of Tennessee, a Southern Unionist who had
been elected Vice President when the people
chose Lincoln a second time for their ruler.
Johnson had been born to grinding poverty in a
rough community where "skule-l'arnin'" was
not to be had. He was a grown man, earning a
scanty livelihood as a village tailor, when his
wife taught him to read and write. He worked
his hard way up in life, became a man of
prominence in his village, in his county, in his
State, until he was chosen for Lincoln's running-mate
as a representative Southern Unionist. He
was of course a man of native force, but he
sometimes drowned his mind in liquor. That
fatal habit pulled him down. He was a failure
as a President, though thereafter he served his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
State and his country well as a United States
Senator from Tennessee.</p>

<p>The White House was changed under its new
ruler. John Hay, full of cheer and wit, was
abroad as a secretary of legation. Nicolay, his
superior officer, was a consul in Europe. The
Lincoln family had gone West through a sorrowing
country, bearing the body of the martyr-President
to its burial-place in Springfield,
Illinois. For a while some familiar faces were
left. At first, the same Cabinet ministers served
the new President. For some time, Uncle Moses
had to learn no new names as he carried about
the summons to the Cabinet meetings. But the
visitors to the White House had changed mightily.
Rough men from Tennessee and the other
Border States, some of them diamonds in the
rough, swarmed there. Lincoln had never used
tobacco. The new-comers both smoked and
chewed. Clouds of smoke filled the lower story
and giant spittoons lined the corridors and invaded
the public rooms. Gradually the Republican
leaders ceased to wait upon the President.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the people who left the White House
soon after Lincoln left it was Tom Strong. On
a bright May morning he walked across the
portico, where Towser was eagerly awaiting
him and where Uncle Moses followed him.
Unk' Mose lifted his withered black hands and
called down blessings on the boy who had been
his angel of freedom and had led him out of
bondage.</p>

<p>"De good Lawd bress you, Mas'r Tom. And
de good Lawd bress dat dar wufless ol' houn'
dawg Towser, too. 'Kase Towser, he lubs you,
Mas'r Tom,&mdash;and so duz I," Uncle Moses shyly
added.</p>

<p>The venerable old negro and the white boy
shook hands in a long farewell upon the steps
of the White House. Then Tom turned away
from the historic roof that had so long sheltered
him and walked to the railroad station, to take
the train for New York. Towser trotted stiffly
by his side, trying at every step to lick his master's
hand.</p>

<p>Tom Strong studied hard at home and then
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
went to Yale, as his father had done before him.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Towser could not go with him. The laws of
Yale forbade it. That is one of the chief disadvantages
of being a dog. Soon after Tom
went to New Haven, Towser went to heaven.
At least, let us hope he did. He deserved to do
so. One of the human things about Martin
Luther, the stern founder of Protestantism in
Germany in the Sixteenth Century, was that he
once said to a tiny girl, weeping over the death
of her tiny dog: "Do not cry, little maid; for
you will find your dog in heaven and he will
have a golden tail."</p>
